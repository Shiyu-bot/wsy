150	THE INTRODUCTION
150	
150	THE Republic of Plato is the longest of his works with the exception of
150	the Laws, and is certainly the greatest of them.  There are nearer
150	approaches to modern metaphysics in the Philebus and in the Sophist;
150	the Politicus or Statesman is more ideal; the form and institutions of
150	the State are more clearly drawn out in the Laws; as works of art, the
150	Symposium and the Protagoras are of higher excellence.  But no other
150	Dialogue of Plato has the same largeness of view and the same
150	perfection of style; no other shows an equal knowledge of the world, or
150	contains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old, and not
150	of one age only but of all.  Nowhere in Plato is there a deeper irony
150	or a greater wealth of humor or imagery, or more dramatic power.  Nor
150	in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweave life and
150	speculation, or to connect politics with philosophy.  The Republic is
150	the centre around which the other Dialogues may be grouped; here
150	philosophy reaches the highest point to which ancient thinkers ever
150	attained.  Plato among the Greeks, like Bacon among the moderns, was
150	the first who conceived a method of knowledge, although neither of them
150	always distinguished the bare outline or form from the substance of
150	truth; and both of them had to be content with an abstraction of
150	science which was not yet realized.  He was the greatest metaphysical
150	genius whom the world has seen; and in him, more than in any other
150	ancient thinker, the germs of future knowledge are contained.  The
150	sciences of logic and psychology, which have supplied so many
150	instruments of thought to after-ages, are based upon the analyses of
150	Socrates and Plato.  The principles of definition, the law of
150	contradiction, the fallacy of arguing in a circle, the distinction
150	between the essence and accidents of a thing or notion, between means
150	and ends, between causes and conditions; also the division of the mind
150	into the rational, concupiscent, and irascible elements, or of
150	pleasures and desires into necessary and unnecessary--these and other
150	great forms of thought are all of them to be found in the Republic, and
150	were probably first invented by Plato.  The greatest of all logical
150	truths, and the one of which writers on philosophy are most apt to lose
150	sight, the difference between words and things, has been most
150	strenuously insisted on by him, although he has not always avoided the
150	confusion of them in his own writings.  But he does not bind up truth
150	in logical formulae,--logic is still veiled in metaphysics; and the
150	"science which he imagines to ""contemplate all truth and all existence"""
150	is very unlike the doctrine of the syllogism which Aristotle claims to
150	have discovered.
150	
150	Neither must we forget that the Republic is but the third part of a
150	still larger design which was to have included an ideal history of
150	Athens, as well as a political and physical philosophy.  The fragment
150	of the Critias has given birth to a world-famous fiction, second only
150	in importance to the tale of Troy and the legend of Arthur; and is said
150	as a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of the
150	sixteenth century.  This mythical tale, of which the subject was a
150	history of the wars of the Athenians against the Island of Atlantis, is
150	supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of Solon, to which it
150	would have stood in the same relation as the writings of the
150	logographers to the poems of Homer.  It would have told of a struggle
150	for Liberty, intended to represent the conflict of Persia and Hellas.
150	We may judge from the noble commencement of the Timaeus, from the
150	fragment of the Critias itself, and from the third book of the Laws, in
150	what manner Plato would have treated this high argument.  We can only
150	guess why the great design was abandoned; perhaps because Plato became
150	sensible of some incongruity in a fictitious history, or because he had
150	lost his interest in it, or because advancing years forbade the
150	completion of it; and we may please ourselves with the fancy that had
150	this imaginary narrative ever been finished, we should have found Plato
150	himself sympathizing with the struggle for Hellenic independence,
150	singing a hymn of triumph over Marathon and Salamis, perhaps making the
150	reflection of Herodotus where he contemplates the growth of the
150	"Athenian empire--""How brave a thing is freedom of speech, which has"
150	made the Athenians so far exceed every other state of Hellas in
150	"greatness!"" or, more probably, attributing the victory to the ancient"
150	good order of Athens and to the favor of Apollo and Athene.
150	
150	"Again, Plato may be regarded as the ""captain"" ('arhchegoz') or leader"
150	of a goodly band of followers; for in the Republic is to be found the
150	original of Cicero's De Republica, of St. Augustine's City of God, of
150	the Utopia of Sir Thomas More, and of the numerous other imaginary
150	States which are framed upon the same model.  The extent to which
150	Aristotle or the Aristotelian school were indebted to him in the
150	Politics has been little recognized, and the recognition is the more
150	necessary because it is not made by Aristotle himself.  The two
150	philosophers had more in common than they were conscious of; and
150	probably some elements of Plato remain still undetected in Aristotle.
150	In English philosophy too, many affinities may be traced, not only in
150	the works of the Cambridge Platonists, but in great original writers
150	like Berkeley or Coleridge, to Plato and his ideas.  That there is a
150	truth higher than experience, of which the mind bears witness to
150	herself, is a conviction which in our own generation has been
150	enthusiastically asserted, and is perhaps gaining ground.  Of the Greek
150	authors who at the Renaissance brought a new life into the world Plato
150	has had the greatest influence.  The Republic of Plato is also the
150	first treatise upon education, of which the writings of Milton and
150	Locke, Rousseau, Jean Paul, and Goethe are the legitimate descendants.
150	Like Dante or Bunyan, he has a revelation of another life; like Bacon,
150	he is profoundly impressed with the unity of knowledge; in the early
150	Church he exercised a real influence on theology, and at the Revival of
150	"Literature on politics.  Even the fragments of his words when ""repeated"
150	"at second-hand"" have in all ages ravished the hearts of men, who have"
150	seen reflected in them their own higher nature.  He is the father of
150	idealism in philosophy, in politics, in literature.  And many of the
150	latest conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen, such as the unity
150	of knowledge, the reign of law, and the equality of the sexes, have
150	been anticipated in a dream by him.
150	
150	
150	
150	ARGUMENT
150	
150	The argument of the Republic is the search after Justice, the nature of
150	which is first hinted at by Cephalus, the just and blameless old
150	man--then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by Socrates and
150	Polemarchus--then caricatured by Thrasymachus and partially explained
150	by Socrates--reduced to an abstraction by Glaucon and Adeimantus, and
150	having become invisible in the individual reappears at length in the
150	ideal State which is constructed by Socrates.  The first care of the
150	rulers is to be education, of which an outline is drawn after the old
150	Hellenic model, providing only for an improved religion and morality,
150	and more simplicity in music and gymnastic, a manlier strain of poetry,
150	and greater harmony of the individual and the State.  We are thus led
150	"on to the conception of a higher State, in which ""no man calls anything"
150	"his own,"" and in which there is neither ""marrying nor giving in"
150	"marriage,"" and ""kings are philosophers"" and ""philosophers are kings;"""
150	and there is another and higher education, intellectual as well as
150	moral and religious, of science as well as of art, and not of youth
150	only but of the whole of life.  Such a State is hardly to be realized
150	in this world and would quickly degenerate.  To the perfect ideal
150	succeeds the government of the soldier and the lover of honor, this
150	again declining into democracy, and democracy into tyranny, in an
150	imaginary but regular order having not much resemblance to the actual
150	"facts.  When ""the wheel has come full circle"" we do not begin again"
150	with a new period of human life; but we have passed from the best to
150	the worst, and there we end.  The subject is then changed and the old
150	quarrel of poetry and philosophy which had been more lightly treated in
150	the earlier books of the Republic is now resumed and fought out to a
150	conclusion.  Poetry is discovered to be an imitation thrice removed
150	from the truth, and Homer, as well as the dramatic poets, having been
150	condemned as an imitator, is sent into banishment along with them.  And
150	the idea of the State is supplemented by the revelation of a future
150	life.
150	
150	The division into books, like all similar divisions, is probably later
150	than the age of Plato.  The natural divisions are five in number;--(1)
150	Book I and the first half of Book II down to the paragraph beginning,
150	"""I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus,"" which is"
150	introductory; the first book containing a refutation of the popular and
150	sophistical notions of justice, and concluding, like some of the
150	earlier Dialogues, without arriving at any definite result.  To this is
150	appended a restatement of the nature of justice according to common
150	opinion, and an answer is demanded to the question--What is justice,
150	stripped of appearances?  The second division (2) includes the
150	remainder of the second and the whole of the third and fourth books,
150	which are mainly occupied with the construction of the first State and
150	the first education.  The third division (3) consists of the fifth,
150	sixth, and seventh books, in which philosophy rather than justice is
150	the subject of inquiry, and the second State is constructed on
150	principles of communism and ruled by philosophers, and the
150	contemplation of the idea of good takes the place of the social and
150	political virtues.  In the eighth and ninth books (4) the perversions
150	of States and of the individuals who correspond to them are reviewed in
150	succession; and the nature of pleasure and the principle of tyranny are
150	further analyzed in the individual man.  The tenth book (5) is the
150	conclusion of the whole, in which the relations of philosophy to poetry
150	are finally determined, and the happiness of the citizens in this life,
150	which has now been assured, is crowned by the vision of another.
150	
150	Or a more general division into two parts may be adopted; the first
150	(Books I-IV) containing the description of a State framed generally in
150	accordance with Hellenic notions of religion and morality, while in the
150	second (Books V-X) the Hellenic State is transformed into an ideal
150	kingdom of philosophy, of which all other governments are the
150	perversions.  These two points of view are really opposed, and the
150	opposition is only veiled by the genius of Plato.  The Republic, like
150	the Phaedrus, is an imperfect whole; the higher light of philosophy
150	breaks through the regularity of the Hellenic temple, which at last
150	fades away into the heavens.  Whether this imperfection of structure
150	arises from an enlargement of the plan; or from the imperfect
150	reconcilement in the writer's own mind of the struggling elements of
150	thought which are now first brought together by him; or, perhaps, from
150	the composition of the work at different times--are questions, like the
150	similar question about the Iliad and the Odyssey, which are worth
150	asking, but which cannot have a distinct answer.  In the age of Plato
150	there was no regular mode of publication, and an author would have the
150	less scruple in altering or adding to a work which was known only to a
150	few of his friends.  There is no absurdity in supposing that he may
150	have laid his labors aside for a time, or turned from one work to
150	another; and such interruptions would be more likely to occur in the
150	case of a long than of a short writing.  In all attempts to determine
150	the chronological he order of the Platonic writings on internal
150	evidence, this uncertainty about any single Dialogue being composed at
150	one time is a disturbing element, which must be admitted to affect
150	longer works, such as the Republic and the Laws, more than shorter
150	ones.  But, on the other hand, the seeming discrepancies of the
150	Republic may only arise out of the discordant elements which the
150	philosopher has attempted to unite in a single whole, perhaps without
150	being himself able to recognize the inconsistency which is obvious to
150	us.  For there is a judgment of after ages which few great writers have
150	ever been able to anticipate for themselves.  They do not perceive the
150	want of connection in their own writings, or the gaps in their systems
150	which are visible enough to those who come after them.  In the
150	beginnings of literature and philosophy, amid the first efforts of
150	thought and language, more inconsistencies occur than now, when the
150	paths of speculation are well worn and the meaning of words precisely
150	defined.  For consistency, too, is the growth of time; and some of the
150	greatest creations of the human mind have been wanting in unity.  Tried
150	by this test, several of the Platonic Dialogues, according to our
150	modern ideas, appear to be defective, but the deficiency is no proof
150	that they were composed at different times or by different hands.  And
150	the supposition that the Republic was written uninterruptedly and by a
150	continuous effort is in some degree confirmed by the numerous
150	references from one part of the work to another.
150	
150	"The second title, ""Concerning Justice,"" is not the one by which the"
150	Republic is quoted, either by Aristotle or generally in antiquity, and,
150	like the other second titles of the Platonic Dialogues, may therefore
150	be assumed to be of later date.  Morgenstern and others have asked
150	whether the definition of justice, which is the professed aim, or the
150	construction of the State is the principal argument of the work.  The
150	answer is, that the two blend in one, and are two faces of the same
150	truth; for justice is the order of the State, and the State is the
150	visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of human society.
150	The one is the soul and the other is the body, and the Greek ideal of
150	the State, as of the individual, is a fair mind in a fair body.  In
150	Hegelian phraseology the State is the reality of which justice is the
150	ideal.  Or, described in Christian language, the kingdom of God is
150	"within, and yet develops into a Church or external kingdom; ""the house"
150	"not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,"" is reduced to the"
150	proportions of an earthly building.  Or, to use a Platonic image,
150	justice and the State are the warp and the woof which run through the
150	whole texture.  And when the constitution of the State is completed,
150	the conception of justice is not dismissed, but reappears under the
150	same or different names throughout the work, both as the inner law of
150	the individual soul, and finally as the principle of rewards and
150	punishments in another life.  The virtues are based on justice, of
150	which common honesty in buying and selling is the shadow, and justice
150	is based on the idea of good, which is the harmony of the world, and is
150	reflected both in the institutions of States and in motions of the
150	heavenly bodies.  The Timaeus, which takes up the political rather than
150	the ethical side of the Republic, and is chiefly occupied with
150	hypotheses concerning the outward world, yet contains many indications
150	that the same law is supposed to reign over the State, over nature, and
150	over man.
150	
150	Too much, however, has been made of this question both in ancient and
150	in modern times.  There is a stage of criticism in which all works,
150	whether of nature or of art, are referred to design.  Now in ancient
150	writings, and indeed in literature generally, there remains often a
150	large element which was not comprehended in the original design.  For
150	the plan grows under the author's hand; new thoughts occur to him in
150	the act of writing; he has not worked out the argument to the end
150	before he begins.  The reader who seeks to find some one idea under
150	which the whole may be conceived, must necessarily seize on the vaguest
150	and most general.  Thus Stallbaum, who is dissatisfied with the
150	ordinary explanations of the argument of the Republic, imagines himself
150	"to have found the true argument ""in the representation of human life in"
150	a State perfected by justice and governed according to the idea of
150	"good."" There may be some use in such general descriptions, but they can"
150	hardly be said to express the design of the writer.  The truth is, that
150	we may as well speak of many designs as of one; nor need anything be
150	excluded from the plan of a great work to which the mind is naturally
150	led by the association of ideas, and which does not interfere with the
150	general purpose.  What kind or degree of unity is to be sought after in
150	a building, in the plastic arts, in poetry, in prose, is a problem
150	which has to be determined relatively to the subject-matter. To Plato
150	"himself, the inquiry ""what was the intention of the writer,"" or ""what"
150	"was the principal argument of the Republic"" would have been hardly"
150	intelligible, and therefore had better be at once dismissed.
150	
150	Is not the Republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which, to
150	Plato's own mind, are most naturally represented in the form of the
150	"State?  Just as in the Jewish prophets the reign of Messiah, or ""the"
150	"day of the Lord,"" or the suffering Servant or people of God, or the"
150	"""Sun of righteousness with healing in his wings"" only convey, to us at"
150	least, their great spiritual ideals, so through the Greek State Plato
150	reveals to us his own thoughts about divine perfection, which is the
150	idea of good--like the sun in the visible world;--about human
150	perfection, which is justice--about education beginning in youth and
150	continuing in later years--about poets and sophists and tyrants who are
150	"the false teachers and evil rulers of mankind--about ""the world"" which"
150	is the embodiment of them--about a kingdom which exists nowhere upon
150	earth but is laid up in heaven to be the pattern and rule of human
150	life.  No such inspired creation is at unity with itself, any more than
150	the clouds of heaven when the sun pierces through them.  Every shade of
150	light and dark, of truth, and of fiction which is the veil of truth, is
150	allowable in a work of philosophical imagination.  It is not all on the
150	same plane; it easily passes from ideas to myths and fancies, from
150	facts to figures of speech.  It is not prose but poetry, at least a
150	great part of it, and ought not to be judged by the rules of logic or
150	the probabilities of history.  The writer is not fashioning his ideas
150	into an artistic whole; they take possession of him and are too much
150	for him.  We have no need therefore to discuss whether a State such as
150	Plato has conceived is practicable or not, or whether the outward form
150	or the inward life came first into the mind of the writer.  For the
150	practicability of his ideas has nothing to do with their truth; and the
150	highest thoughts to which he attains may be truly said to bear the
150	"greatest ""marks of design""--justice more than the external frame-work"
150	of the State, the idea of good more than justice.  The great science of
150	dialectic or the organization of ideas has no real content; but is only
150	a type of the method or spirit in which the higher knowledge is to be
150	pursued by the spectator of all time and all existence.  It is in the
150	"fifth, sixth, and seventh books that Plato reaches the ""summit of"
150	"speculation,"" and these, although they fail to satisfy the requirements"
150	of a modern thinker, may therefore be regarded as the most important,
150	as they are also the most original, portions of the work.
150	
150	It is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question which has
150	been raised by Boeckh, respecting the imaginary date at which the
150	conversation was held (the year 411 B. C. which is proposed by him will
150	do as well as any other); for a writer of fiction, and especially a
150	writer who, like Plato, is notoriously careless of chronology, only
150	aims at general probability.  Whether all the persons mentioned in the
150	Republic could ever have met at any one time is not a difficulty which
150	would have occurred to an Athenian reading the work forty years later,
150	or to Plato himself at the time of writing (any more than to
150	Shakespeare respecting one of his own dramas); and need not greatly
150	"trouble us now.  Yet this may be a question having no answer ""which is"
150	"still worth asking,"" because the investigation shows that we can not"
150	argue historically from the dates in Plato; it would be useless
150	therefore to waste time in inventing far-fetched reconcilements of them
150	in order avoid chronological difficulties, such, for example, as the
150	conjecture of C. F. Hermann, that Glaucon and Adeimantus are not the
150	brothers but the uncles of Plato, or the fancy of Stallbaum that Plato
150	intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates at which some of
150	his Dialogues were written.
150	
150	
150	
150	CHARACTERS
150	
150	The principal characters in the Republic are Cephalus, Polemarchus,
150	Thrasymachus, Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus.  Cephalus appears in
150	the introduction only, Polemarchus drops at the end of the first
150	argument, and Thrasymachus is reduced to silence at the close of the
150	first book.  The main discussion is carried on by Socrates, Glaucon,
150	and Adeimantus.  Among the company are Lysias (the orator) and
150	Euthydemus, the sons of Cephalus and brothers of Polemarchus, an
150	unknown Charmantides--these are mute auditors; also there is
150	Cleitophon, who once interrupts, where, as in the Dialogue which bears
150	his name, he appears as the friend and ally of Thrasymachus.
150	
150	Cephalus, the patriarch of house, has been appropriately engaged in
150	offering a sacrifice.  He is the pattern of an old man who has almost
150	done with life, and is at peace with himself and with all mankind.  He
150	feels that he is drawing nearer to the world below, and seems to linger
150	around the memory of the past.  He is eager that Socrates should come
150	to visit him, fond of the poetry of the last generation, happy in the
150	consciousness of a well-spent life, glad at having escaped from the
150	tyranny of youthful lusts.  His love of conversation, his affection,
150	his indifference to riches, even his garrulity, are interesting traits
150	of character.  He is not one of those who have nothing to say, because
150	their whole mind has been absorbed in making money.  Yet he
150	acknowledges that riches have the advantage of placing men above the
150	temptation to dishonesty or falsehood.  The respectful attention shown
150	to him by Socrates, whose love of conversation, no less than the
150	mission imposed upon him by the Oracle, leads him to ask questions of
150	all men, young and old alike, should also be noted.  Who better suited
150	to raise the question of justice than Cephalus, whose life might seem
150	to be the expression of it?  The moderation with which old age is
150	pictured by Cephalus as a very tolerable portion of existence is
150	characteristic, not only of him, but of Greek feeling generally, and
150	contrasts with the exaggeration of Cicero in the De Senectute.  The
150	evening of life is described by Plato in the most expressive manner,
150	yet with the fewest possible touches.  As Cicero remarks (Ep. ad Attic.
150	iv. 16), the aged Cephalus would have been out of place in the
150	discussion which follows, and which he could neither have understood
150	nor taken part in without a violation of dramatic propriety.
150	
150	"His ""son and heir"" Polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousness of"
150	youth; he is for detaining Socrates by force in the opening scene, and
150	"will not ""let him off"" on the subject of women and children.  Like"
150	Cephalus, he is limited in his point of view, and represents the
150	proverbial stage of morality which has rules of life rather than
150	principles; and he quotes Simonides as his father had quoted Pindar.
150	But after this he has no more to say; the answers which he makes are
150	only elicited from him by the dialectic of Socrates.  He has not yet
150	experienced the influence of the Sophists like Glaucon and Adeimantus,
150	nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting them; he belongs to the
150	pre-Socratic or pre-dialectical age.  He is incapable of arguing, and
150	is bewildered by Socrates to such a degree that he does not know what
150	he is saying.  He is made to admit that justice is a thief, and that
150	the virtues follow the analogy of the arts.  From his brother Lysias we
150	learn that he fell a victim to the Thirty Tyrants, but no allusion is
150	here made to his fate, nor to the circumstance that Cephalus and his
150	family were of Syracusan origin, and had migrated from Thurii to Athens.
150	
150	"The ""Chalcedonian giant,"" Thrasymachus, of whom we have already heard"
150	in the Phaedrus, is the personification of the Sophists, according to
150	Plato's conception of them, in some of their worst characteristics.  He
150	is vain and blustering, refusing to discourse unless he is paid, fond
150	of making an oration, and hoping thereby to escape the inevitable
150	Socrates; but a mere child in argument, and unable to foresee that the
150	"next ""move"" (to use a Platonic expression) will ""shut him up.""  He has"
150	reached the stage of framing general notions, and in this respect is in
150	advance of Cephalus and Polemarchus.  But he is incapable of defending
150	them in a discussion, and vainly tries to cover his confusion in banter
150	and insolence.  Whether such doctrines as are attributed to him by
150	Plato were really held either by him or by any other Sophist is
150	uncertain; in the infancy of philosophy serious errors about morality
150	might easily grow up--they are certainly put into the mouths of
150	speakers in Thucydides; but we are concerned at present with Plato's
150	description of him, and not with the historical reality.  The
150	inequality of the contest adds greatly to the humor of the scene.  The
150	pompous and empty Sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great
150	master of dialectic, who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity
150	and weakness in him.  He is greatly irritated by the irony of Socrates,
150	but his noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to the
150	thrusts of his assailant.  His determination to cram down their
150	"throats, or put ""bodily into their souls"" his own words, elicits a cry"
150	of horror from Socrates.  The state of his temper is quite as worthy of
150	remark as the process of the argument.  Nothing is more amusing than
150	his complete submission when he has been once thoroughly beaten.  At
150	first he seems to continue the discussion with reluctance, but soon
150	with apparent good-will, and he even testifies his interest at a later
150	stage by one or two occasional remarks.  When attacked by Glaucon he is
150	"humorously protected by Socrates ""as one who has never been his enemy"
150	"and is now his friend."" From Cicero and Quintilian and from Aristotle's"
150	Rhetoric we learn that the Sophist whom Plato has made so ridiculous
150	was a man of note whose writings were preserved in later ages.  The
150	"play on his name which was made by his contemporary Herodicus, ""thou"
150	"wast ever bold in battle,"" seems to show that the description of him is"
150	not devoid of verisimilitude.
150	
150	When Thrasymachus has been silenced, the two principal respondents,
150	Glaucon and Adeimantus, appear on the scene:  here, as in Greek
150	tragedy, three actors are introduced.  At first sight the two sons of
150	Ariston may seem to wear a family likeness, like the two friends
150	Simmias and Cebes in the Phaedo.  But on a nearer examination of them
150	the similarity vanishes, and they are seen to be distinct characters.
150	"Glaucon is the impetuous youth who can ""just never have enough of"
150	"fechting"" (cf. the character of him in Xen. Mem. iii. 6); the man of"
150	"pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of love; the ""juvenis qui"
150	"gaudet canibus,"" and who improves the breed of animals; the lover of"
150	art and music who has all the experiences of youthful life.  He is full
150	of quickness and penetration, piercing easily below the clumsy
150	platitudes of Thrasymachus to the real difficulty; he turns out to the
150	light the seamy side of human life, and yet does not lose faith in the
150	just and true.  It is Glaucon who seizes what may be termed the
150	ludicrous relation of the philosopher to the world, to whom a state of
150	"simplicity is ""a city of pigs,"" who is always prepared with a jest when"
150	the argument offers him an opportunity, and who is ever ready to second
150	the humor of Socrates and to appreciate the ridiculous, whether in the
150	connoisseurs of music, or in the lovers of theatricals, or in the
150	fantastic behavior of the citizens of democracy.  His weaknesses are
150	several times alluded to by Socrates, who, however, will not allow him
150	to be attacked by his brother Adeimantus.  He is a soldier, and, like
150	Adeimantus, has been distinguished at the battle of Megara.
150	
150	The character of Adeimantus is deeper and graver, and the profounder
150	objections are commonly put into his mouth.  Glaucon is more
150	demonstrative, and generally opens the game.  Adeimantus pursues the
150	argument further.  Glaucon has more of the liveliness and quick
150	sympathy of youth; Adeimantus has the maturer judgment of a grown-up
150	man of the world.  In the second book, when Glaucon insists that
150	justice and injustice shall be considered without regard to their
150	consequences, Adeimantus remarks that they are regarded by mankind in
150	general only for the sake of their consequences; and in a similar vein
150	of reflection he urges at the beginning of the fourth book that
150	Socrates falls in making his citizens happy, and is answered that
150	happiness is not the first but the second thing, not the direct aim but
150	the indirect consequence of the good government of a State.  In the
150	discussion about religion and mythology, Adeimantus is the respondent,
150	but Glaucon breaks in with a slight jest, and carries on the
150	conversation in a lighter tone about music and gymnastic to the end of
150	the book.  It is Adeimantus again who volunteers the criticism of
150	common sense on the Socratic method of argument, and who refuses to let
150	Socrates pass lightly over the question of women and children.  It is
150	Adeimantus who is the respondent in the more argumentative, as Glaucon
150	in the lighter and more imaginative portions of the Dialogue.  For
150	example, throughout the greater part of the sixth book, the causes of
150	the corruption of philosophy and the conception of the idea of good are
150	discussed with Adeimantus.  Then Glaucon resumes his place of principal
150	respondent; but he has a difficulty in apprehending the higher
150	education of Socrates, and makes some false hits in the course of the
150	discussion.  Once more Adeimantus returns with the allusion to his
150	brother Glaucon whom he compares to the contentious State; in the next
150	book he is again superseded, and Glaucon continues to the end.
150	
150	Thus in a succession of characters Plato represents the successive
150	stages of morality, beginning with the Athenian gentleman of the olden
150	time, who is followed by the practical man of that day regulating his
150	life by proverbs and saws; to him succeeds the wild generalization of
150	the Sophists, and lastly come the young disciples of the great teacher,
150	who know the sophistical arguments but will not be convinced by them,
150	and desire to go deeper into the nature of things.  These too, like
150	Cephalus, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus, are clearly distinguished from one
150	another.  Neither in the Republic, nor in any other Dialogue of Plato,
150	is a single character repeated.
150	
150	The delineation of Socrates in the Republic is not wholly consistent.
150	In the first book we have more of the real Socrates, such as he is
150	depicted in the Memorabilia of Xenophon, in the earliest Dialogues of
150	Plato, and in the Apology.  He is ironical, provoking, questioning, the
150	old enemy of the Sophists, ready to put on the mask of Silenus as well
150	as to argue seriously.  But in the sixth book his enmity towards the
150	Sophists abates; he acknowledges that they are the representatives
150	rather than the corrupters of the world.  He also becomes more dogmatic
150	and constructive, passing beyond the range either of the political or
150	the speculative ideas of the real Socrates.  In one passage Plato
150	himself seems to intimate that the time had now come for Socrates, who
150	had passed his whole life in philosophy, to give his own opinion and
150	not to be always repeating the notions of other men.  There is no
150	evidence that either the idea of good or the conception of a perfect
150	State were comprehended in the Socratic teaching, though he certainly
150	dwelt on the nature of the universal and of final causes (cp. Xen.
150	Mem. i. 4; Phaedo 97); and a deep thinker like him in his thirty or
150	forty years of public teaching, could hardly have falled to touch on
150	the nature of family relations, for which there is also some positive
150	evidence in the Memorabilia (Mem. i. 2, 51 foll.) The Socratic method
150	is nominally retained; and every inference is either put into the mouth
150	of the respondent or represented as the common discovery of him and
150	Socrates.  But any one can see that this is a mere form, of which the
150	affectation grows wearisome as the work advances.  The method of
150	inquiry has passed into a method of teaching in which by the help of
150	interlocutors the same thesis is looked at from various points of view.
150	
150	The nature of the process is truly characterized by Glaucon, when he
150	describes himself as a companion who is not good for much in an
150	investigation, but can see what he is shown, and may, perhaps, give the
150	answer to a question more fluently than another.
150	
150	Neither can we be absolutely certain that, Socrates himself taught the
150	immortality of the soul, which is unknown to his disciple Glaucon in
150	the Republic; nor is there any reason to suppose that he used myths or
150	revelations of another world as a vehicle of instruction, or that he
150	would have banished poetry or have denounced the Greek mythology.  His
150	favorite oath is retained, and a slight mention is made of the
150	daemonium, or internal sign, which is alluded to by Socrates as a
150	phenomenon peculiar to himself.  A real element of Socratic teaching,
150	which is more prominent in the Republic than in any of the other
150	Dialogues of Plato, is the use of example and illustration
150	"('taphorhtika auto prhospherhontez'): ""Let us apply the test of common"
150	"instances."" ""You,"" says Adeimantus, ironically, in the sixth book, ""are"
150	"so unaccustomed to speak in images.""  And this use of examples or"
150	images, though truly Socratic in origin, is enlarged by the genius of
150	Plato into the form of an allegory or parable, which embodies in the
150	concrete what has been already described, or is about to be described,
150	in the abstract.  Thus the figure of the cave in Book VII is a
150	recapitulation of the divisions of knowledge in Book VI.  The composite
150	animal in Book IX is an allegory of the parts of the soul.  The noble
150	captain and the ship and the true pilot in Book VI are a figure of the
150	relation of the people to the philosophers in the State which has been
150	described.  Other figures, such as the dog in the second, third, and
150	fourth books, or the marriage of the portionless maiden in the sixth
150	book, or the drones and wasps in the eighth and ninth books, also form
150	links of connection in long passages, or are used to recall previous
150	discussions.
150	
150	Plato is most true to the character of his master when he describes him
150	"as ""not of this world.""  And with this representation of him the ideal"
150	State and the other paradoxes of the Republic are quite in accordance,
150	though they can not be shown to have been speculations of Socrates.  To
150	him, as to other great teachers both philosophical and religious, when
150	they looked upward, the world seemed to be the embodiment of error and
150	evil.  The common sense of mankind has revolted against this view, or
150	has only partially admitted it.  And even in Socrates himself the
150	sterner judgment of the multitude at times passes into a sort of
150	ironical pity or love.  Men in general are incapable of philosophy, and
150	are therefore at enmity with the philosopher; but their
150	misunderstanding of him is unavoidable: for they have never seen him as
150	he truly is in his own image; they are only acquainted with artificial
150	systems possessing no native force of truth--words which admit of many
150	applications.  Their leaders have nothing to measure with, and are
150	therefore ignorant of their own stature.  But they are to be pitied or
150	laughed at, not to be quarrelled with; they mean well with their
150	nostrums, if they could only learn that they are cutting off a Hydra's
150	head.  This moderation towards those who are in error is one of the
150	most characteristic features of Socrates in the Republic.  In all the
150	different representations of Socrates, whether of Xenophon or Plato,
150	and the differences of the earlier or later Dialogues, he always
150	retains the character of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after
150	truth, without which he would have ceased to be Socrates.
150	
150	Leaving the characters we may now analyze the contents of the Republic,
150	and then proceed to consider (1) The general aspects of this Hellenic
150	ideal of the State, (2) The modern lights in which the thoughts of
150	Plato may be read.

150	
150	SOCRATES - GLAUCON
150	
150	I WENT down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston,
150	that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess; and also because I
150	wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival, which
150	was a new thing.  I was delighted with the procession of the
150	inhabitants; but that of the Thracians was equally, if not more,
150	beautiful.  When we had finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle,
150	we turned in the direction of the city; and at that instant Polemarchus
150	the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a distance as we
150	were starting on our way home, and told his servant to run and bid us
150	wait for him.  The servant took hold of me by the cloak behind, and
150	said: Polemarchus desires you to wait.
150	
150	I turned round, and asked him where his master was.
150	
150	There he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only wait.
150	
150	Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus
150	appeared, and with him Adeimantus, Glaucon's brother, Niceratus the son
150	of Nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.
150	
150	SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS - GLAUCON - ADEIMANTUS
150	
150	Polemarchus said to me:  I perceive, Socrates, that you and our
150	companion are already on your way to the city.
150	
150	You are not far wrong, I said.
150	
150	But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to
150	remain where you are.
150	
150	May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade you to
150	let us go?
150	
150	But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said.
150	
150	Certainly not, replied Glaucon.
150	
150	Then we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.
150	
150	Adeimantus added:  Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback
150	in honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening?
150	
150	With horses!  I replied:  That is a novelty.  Will horsemen carry
150	torches and pass them one to another during the race?
150	
150	Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will he
150	celebrated at night, which you certainly ought to see.  Let us rise
150	soon after supper and see this festival; there will be a gathering of
150	young men, and we will have a good talk.  Stay then, and do not be
150	perverse.
150	
150	Glaucon said:  I suppose, since you insist, that we must.
150	
150	Very good, I replied.
150	
150	GLAUCON - CEPHALUS - SOCRATES
150	
150	Accordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house; and there we found
150	his brothers Lysias and Euthydemus, and with them Thrasymachus the
150	Chalcedonian, Charmantides the Paeanian, and Cleitophon the son of
150	Aristonymus.  There too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus, whom I
150	had not seen for a long time, and I thought him very much aged.  He was
150	seated on a cushioned chair, and had a garland on his head, for he had
150	been sacrificing in the court; and there were some other chairs in the
150	room arranged in a semicircle, upon which we sat down by him.  He
150	saluted me eagerly, and then he said:--
150	
150	You don't come to see me, Socrates, as often as you ought: If I were
150	still able to go and see you I would not ask you to come to me.  But at
150	my age I can hardly get to the city, and therefore you should come
150	oftener to the Piraeus.  For let me tell you, that the more the
150	pleasures of the body fade away, the greater to me is the pleasure and
150	charm of conversation.  Do not then deny my request, but make our house
150	your resort and keep company with these young men; we are old friends,
150	and you will be quite at home with us.
150	
150	I replied:  There is nothing which for my part I like better, Cephalus,
150	than conversing with aged men; for I regard them as travellers who have
150	gone a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom I ought to
150	enquire, whether the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult.
150	And this is a question which I should like to ask of you who have
150	arrived at that time which the poets call the 'threshold of old
150	age'--Is life harder towards the end, or what report do you give of it?
150	
150	I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is.  Men of my
150	age flock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb says;
150	and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is--I cannot
150	eat, I cannot drink; the pleasures of youth and love are fled away:
150	there was a good time once, but now that is gone, and life is no longer
150	life.  Some complain of the slights which are put upon them by
150	relations, and they will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age
150	is the cause.  But to me, Socrates, these complainers seem to blame
150	that which is not really in fault.  For if old age were the cause, I
150	too being old, and every other old man, would have felt as they do.
150	But this is not my own experience, nor that of others whom I have
150	known.  How well I remember the aged poet Sophocles, when in answer to
150	the question, How does love suit with age, Sophocles,--are you still
150	the man you were?  Peace, he replied; most gladly have I escaped the
150	thing of which you speak; I feel as if I had escaped from a mad and
150	furious master.  His words have often occurred to my mind since, and
150	they seem as good to me now as at the time when he uttered them.  For
150	certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom; when the
150	passions relax their hold, then, as Sophocles says, we are freed from
150	the grasp not of one mad master only, but of many.  The truth is,
150	Socrates, that these regrets, and also the complaints about relations,
150	are to be attributed to the same cause, which is not old age, but men's
150	characters and tempers; for he who is of a calm and happy nature will
150	hardly feel the pressure of age, but to him who is of an opposite
150	disposition youth and age are equally a burden.
150	
150	I listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he might go
150	on--Yes, Cephalus, I said:  but I rather suspect that people in general
150	are not convinced by you when you speak thus; they think that old age
150	sits lightly upon you, not because of your happy disposition, but
150	because you are rich, and wealth is well known to be a great comforter.
150	
150	You are right, he replied; they are not convinced:  and there is
150	something in what they say; not, however, so much as they imagine.  I
150	might answer them as Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was
150	abusing him and saying that he was famous, not for his own merits but
150	because he was an Athenian:  'If you had been a native of my country or
150	I of yours, neither of us would have been famous.' And to those who are
150	not rich and are impatient of old age, the same reply may be made; for
150	to the good poor man old age cannot be a light burden, nor can a bad
150	rich man ever have peace with himself.
150	
150	May I ask, Cephalus, whether your fortune was for the most part
150	inherited or acquired by you?
150	
150	Acquired!  Socrates; do you want to know how much I acquired?  In the
150	art of making money I have been midway between my father and
150	grandfather: for my grandfather, whose name I bear, doubled and trebled
150	the value of his patrimony, that which he inherited being much what I
150	possess now; but my father Lysanias reduced the property below what it
150	is at present: and I shall be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not
150	less but a little more than I received.
150	
150	That was why I asked you the question, I replied, because I see that
150	you are indifferent about money, which is a characteristic rather of
150	those who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired
150	them; the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation
150	of their own, resembling the affection of authors for their own poems,
150	or of parents for their children, besides that natural love of it for
150	the sake of use and profit which is common to them and all men.  And
150	hence they are very bad company, for they can talk about nothing but
150	the praises of wealth.  That is true, he said.
150	
150	Yes, that is very true, but may I ask another question?  What do you
150	consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your
150	wealth?
150	
150	One, he said, of which I could not expect easily to convince others.
150	For let me tell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be
150	near death, fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had
150	before; the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted
150	there of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him, but now he
150	is tormented with the thought that they may be true: either from the
150	weakness of age, or because he is now drawing nearer to that other
150	place, he has a clearer view of these things; suspicions and alarms
150	crowd thickly upon him, and he begins to reflect and consider what
150	wrongs he has done to others.  And when he finds that the sum of his
150	transgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in
150	his sleep for fear, and he is filled with dark forebodings.  But to him
150	who is conscious of no sin, sweet hope, as Pindar charmingly says, is
150	the kind nurse of his age:
150	
150	    Hope, he says, cherishes the soul of him who lives in
150	    justice and holiness and is the nurse of his age and the
150	    companion of his journey;--hope which is mightiest to sway
150	    the restless soul of man.
150	
150	How admirable are his words!  And the great blessing of riches, I do
150	not say to every man, but to a good man, is, that he has had no
150	occasion to deceive or to defraud others, either intentionally or
150	unintentionally; and when he departs to the world below he is not in
150	any apprehension about offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes
150	to men.  Now to this peace of mind the possession of wealth greatly
150	contributes; and therefore I say, that, setting one thing against
150	another, of the many advantages which wealth has to give, to a man of
150	sense this is in my opinion the greatest.
150	
150	Well said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, what is
150	it?--to speak the truth and to pay your debts--no more than this?  And
150	even to this are there not exceptions?  Suppose that a friend when in
150	his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he
150	is not in his right mind, ought I to give them back to him?  No one
150	would say that I ought or that I should be right in doing so, any more
150	than they would say that I ought always to speak the truth to one who
150	is in his condition.
150	
150	You are quite right, he replied.
150	
150	But then, I said, speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a
150	correct definition of justice.
150	
150	CEPHALUS - SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS
150	
150	Quite correct, Socrates, if Simonides is to be believed, said
150	Polemarchus interposing.
150	
150	I fear, said Cephalus, that I must go now, for I have to look after the
150	sacrifices, and I hand over the argument to Polemarchus and the company.
150	
150	Is not Polemarchus your heir?  I said.
150	
150	To be sure, he answered, and went away laughing to the sacrifices.
150	
150	SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS
150	
150	Tell me then, O thou heir of the argument, what did Simonides say, and
150	according to you truly say, about justice?
150	
150	He said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so he
150	appears to me to be right.
150	
150	I should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired man,
150	but his meaning, though probably clear to you, is the reverse of clear
150	to me.  For he certainly does not mean, as we were now saying that I
150	ought to return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one
150	who asks for it when he is not in his right senses; and yet a deposit
150	cannot be denied to be a debt.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by no
150	means to make the return?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	When Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice, he did
150	not mean to include that case?
150	
150	Certainly not; for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good to a
150	friend and never evil.
150	
150	You mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury of
150	the receiver, if the two parties are friends, is not the repayment of a
150	debt,--that is what you would imagine him to say?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?
150	
150	To be sure, he said, they are to receive what we owe them, and an
150	enemy, as I take it, owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to
150	him--that is to say, evil.
150	
150	Simonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have spoken
150	darkly of the nature of justice; for he really meant to say that
150	justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him, and this he
150	termed a debt.
150	
150	That must have been his meaning, he said.
150	
150	By heaven!  I replied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing is
150	given by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he would
150	make to us?
150	
150	He would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink to
150	human bodies.
150	
150	And what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?
150	
150	Seasoning to food.
150	
150	And what is that which justice gives, and to whom?
150	
150	If, Socrates, we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the
150	preceding instances, then justice is the art which gives good to
150	friends and evil to enemies.
150	
150	That is his meaning then?
150	
150	I think so.
150	
150	And who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies
150	in time of sickness?
150	
150	The physician.
150	
150	Or when they are on a voyage, amid the perils of the sea?
150	
150	The pilot.
150	
150	And in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just
150	man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friends?
150	
150	In going to war against the one and in making alliances with the other.
150	
150	But when a man is well, my dear Polemarchus, there is no need of a
150	physician?
150	
150	No.
150	
150	And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?
150	
150	No.
150	
150	Then in time of peace justice will be of no use?
150	
150	I am very far from thinking so.
150	
150	You think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Like husbandry for the acquisition of corn?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes,--that is what you mean?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of
150	peace?
150	
150	In contracts, Socrates, justice is of use.
150	
150	And by contracts you mean partnerships?
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	But is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better
150	partner at a game of draughts?
150	
150	The skilful player.
150	
150	And in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful or
150	better partner than the builder?
150	
150	Quite the reverse.
150	
150	Then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than
150	the harp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly a
150	better partner than the just man?
150	
150	In a money partnership.
150	
150	Yes, Polemarchus, but surely not in the use of money; for you do not
150	want a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a horse;
150	a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that, would he
150	not?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would be
150	better?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man is
150	to be preferred?
150	
150	When you want a deposit to be kept safely.
150	
150	You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie?
150	
150	Precisely.
150	
150	That is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?
150	
150	That is the inference.
150	
150	And when you want to keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice is useful
150	to the individual and to the state; but when you want to use it, then
150	the art of the vine-dresser?
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	And when you want to keep a shield or a lyre, and not to use them, you
150	would say that justice is useful; but when you want to use them, then
150	the art of the soldier or of the musician?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And so of all the other things;--justice is useful when they are
150	useless, and useless when they are useful?
150	
150	That is the inference.
150	
150	Then justice is not good for much.  But let us consider this further
150	point:  Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in
150	any kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is
150	best able to create one?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march
150	upon the enemy?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief?
150	
150	That, I suppose, is to be inferred.
150	
150	Then if the just man is good at keeping money, he is good at stealing
150	it.
150	
150	That is implied in the argument.
150	
150	Then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief.  And this is
150	a lesson which I suspect you must have learnt out of Homer; for he,
150	speaking of Autolycus, the maternal grandfather of Odysseus, who is a
150	favourite of his, affirms that
150	
150	    He was excellent above all men in theft and perjury.
150	
150	And so, you and Homer and Simonides are agreed that justice is an art
150	of theft; to be practised however 'for the good of friends and for the
150	harm of enemies,'--that was what you were saying?
150	
150	No, certainly not that, though I do not now know what I did say; but I
150	still stand by the latter words.
150	
150	Well, there is another question:  By friends and enemies do we mean
150	those who are so really, or only in seeming?
150	
150	Surely, he said, a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks
150	good, and to hate those whom he thinks evil.
150	
150	Yes, but do not persons often err about good and evil: many who are not
150	good seem to be so, and conversely?
150	
150	That is true.
150	
150	Then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their
150	friends?  True.
150	
150	And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil
150	to the good?
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	But the good are just and would not do an injustice?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no
150	wrong?
150	
150	Nay, Socrates; the doctrine is immoral.
150	
150	Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the
150	unjust?
150	
150	I like that better.
150	
150	But see the consequence:--Many a man who is ignorant of human nature
150	has friends who are bad friends, and in that case he ought to do harm
150	to them; and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit; but, if so,
150	we shall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be
150	the meaning of Simonides.
150	
150	Very true, he said:  and I think that we had better correct an error
150	into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words 'friend' and
150	'enemy.'
150	
150	What was the error, Polemarchus?  I asked.
150	
150	We assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good.
150	
150	And how is the error to be corrected?
150	
150	We should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as seems,
150	good; and that he who seems only, and is not good, only seems to be and
150	is not a friend; and of an enemy the same may be said.
150	
150	You would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to do
150	good to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say: It
150	is just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our
150	enemies when they are evil?
150	
150	Yes, that appears to me to be the truth.
150	
150	But ought the just to injure any one at all?
150	
150	Undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his
150	enemies.
150	
150	When horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated?
150	
150	The latter.
150	
150	Deteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, not of
150	dogs?
150	
150	Yes, of horses.
150	
150	And dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of
150	horses?
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	And will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the
150	proper virtue of man?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And that human virtue is justice?
150	
150	To be sure.
150	
150	Then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust?
150	
150	That is the result.
150	
150	But can the musician by his art make men unmusical?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	And can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can
150	the good by virtue make them bad?
150	
150	Assuredly not.
150	
150	Any more than heat can produce cold?
150	
150	It cannot.
150	
150	Or drought moisture?
150	
150	Clearly not.
150	
150	Nor can the good harm any one?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	And the just is the good?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man,
150	but of the opposite, who is the unjust?
150	
150	I think that what you say is quite true, Socrates.
150	
150	Then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts, and
150	that good is the debt which a man owes to his friends, and evil the
150	debt which he owes to his enemies,--to say this is not wise; for it is
150	not true, if, as has been clearly shown, the injuring of another can be
150	in no case just.
150	
150	I agree with you, said Polemarchus.
150	
150	Then you and I are prepared to take up arms against any one who
150	attributes such a saying to Simonides or Bias or Pittacus, or any other
150	wise man or seer?
150	
150	I am quite ready to do battle at your side, he said.
150	
150	Shall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be?
150	
150	Whose?
150	
150	I believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban,
150	or some other rich and mighty man, who had a great opinion of his own
150	power, was the first to say that justice is 'doing good to your friends
150	and harm to your enemies.'
150	
150	Most true, he said.
150	
150	Yes, I said; but if this definition of justice also breaks down, what
150	other can be offered?
150	
150	Several times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had made an
150	attempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put down
150	by the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end.  But when
150	Polemarchus and I had done speaking and there was a pause, he could no
150	longer hold his peace; and, gathering himself up, he came at us like a
150	wild beast, seeking to devour us.  We were quite panic-stricken at the
150	sight of him.
150	
150	SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS
150	
150	He roared out to the whole company:  What folly.  Socrates, has taken
150	possession of you all?  And why, sillybillies, do you knock under to
150	one another?  I say that if you want really to know what justice is,
150	you should not only ask but answer, and you should not seek honour to
150	yourself from the refutation of an opponent, but have your own answer;
150	for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer.  And now I will
150	not have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit or gain or
150	interest, for this sort of nonsense will not do for me; I must have
150	clearness and accuracy.
150	
150	I was panic-stricken at his words, and could not look at him without
150	trembling.  Indeed I believe that if I had not fixed my eye upon him, I
150	should have been struck dumb:  but when I saw his fury rising, I looked
150	at him first, and was therefore able to reply to him.
150	
150	Thrasymachus, I said, with a quiver, don't be hard upon us.
150	Polemarchus and I may have been guilty of a little mistake in the
150	argument, but I can assure you that the error was not intentional.  If
150	we were seeking for a piece of gold, you would not imagine that we were
150	'knocking under to one another,' and so losing our chance of finding
150	it.  And why, when we are seeking for justice, a thing more precious
150	than many pieces of gold, do you say that we are weakly yielding to one
150	another and not doing our utmost to get at the truth?  Nay, my good
150	friend, we are most willing and anxious to do so, but the fact is that
150	we cannot.  And if so, you people who know all things should pity us
150	and not be angry with us.
150	
150	How characteristic of Socrates! he replied, with a bitter
150	laugh;--that's your ironical style!  Did I not foresee--have I not
150	already told you, that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer,
150	and try irony or any other shuffle, in order that he might avoid
150	answering?
150	
150	You are a philosopher, Thrasymachus, I replied, and well know that if
150	you ask a person what numbers make up twelve, taking care to prohibit
150	him whom you ask from answering twice six, or three times four, or six
150	times two, or four times three, 'for this sort of nonsense will not do
150	for me,'--then obviously, that is your way of putting the question, no
150	one can answer you.  But suppose that he were to retort, 'Thrasymachus,
150	what do you mean?  If one of these numbers which you interdict be the
150	true answer to the question, am I falsely to say some other number
150	which is not the right one?--is that your meaning?'--How would you
150	answer him?
150	
150	Just as if the two cases were at all alike! he said.
150	
150	Why should they not be?  I replied; and even if they are not, but only
150	appear to be so to the person who is asked, ought he not to say what he
150	thinks, whether you and I forbid him or not?
150	
150	I presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted
150	answers?
150	
150	I dare say that I may, notwithstanding the danger, if upon reflection I
150	approve of any of them.
150	
150	But what if I give you an answer about justice other and better, he
150	said, than any of these?  What do you deserve to have done to you?
150	
150	Done to me!--as becomes the ignorant, I must learn from the wise--that
150	is what I deserve to have done to me.
150	
150	What, and no payment! a pleasant notion!
150	
150	I will pay when I have the money, I replied.
150	
150	SOCRATES - THRASYMACHUS - GLAUCON
150	
150	But you have, Socrates, said Glaucon:  and you, Thrasymachus, need be
150	under no anxiety about money, for we will all make a contribution for
150	Socrates.
150	
150	Yes, he replied, and then Socrates will do as he always does--refuse to
150	answer himself, but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one else.
150	
150	Why, my good friend, I said, how can any one answer who knows, and says
150	that he knows, just nothing; and who, even if he has some faint notions
150	of his own, is told by a man of authority not to utter them?  The
150	natural thing is, that the speaker should be some one like yourself who
150	professes to know and can tell what he knows.  Will you then kindly
150	answer, for the edification of the company and of myself?
150	
150	Glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request and
150	Thrasymachus, as any one might see, was in reality eager to speak; for
150	he thought that he had an excellent answer, and would distinguish
150	himself.  But at first he to insist on my answering; at length he
150	consented to begin.  Behold, he said, the wisdom of Socrates; he
150	refuses to teach himself, and goes about learning of others, to whom he
150	never even says thank you.
150	
150	That I learn of others, I replied, is quite true; but that I am
150	ungrateful I wholly deny.  Money I have none, and therefore I pay in
150	praise, which is all I have:  and how ready I am to praise any one who
150	appears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when you
150	answer; for I expect that you will answer well.
150	
150	Listen, then, he said; I proclaim that justice is nothing else than the
150	interest of the stronger.  And now why do you not me?  But of course
150	you won't.
150	
150	Let me first understand you, I replied.  Justice, as you say, is the
150	interest of the stronger.  What, Thrasymachus, is the meaning of this?
150	You cannot mean to say that because Polydamas, the pancratiast, is
150	stronger than we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his
150	bodily strength, that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who
150	are weaker than he is, and right and just for us?
150	
150	That's abominable of you, Socrates; you take the words in the sense
150	which is most damaging to the argument.
150	
150	Not at all, my good sir, I said; I am trying to understand them; and I
150	wish that you would be a little clearer.
150	
150	Well, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ;
150	there are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are
150	aristocracies?
150	
150	Yes, I know.
150	
150	And the government is the ruling power in each state?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And the different forms of government make laws democratical,
150	aristocratical, tyrannical, with a view to their several interests; and
150	these laws, which are made by them for their own interests, are the
150	justice which they deliver to their subjects, and him who transgresses
150	them they punish as a breaker of the law, and unjust.  And that is what
150	I mean when I say that in all states there is the same principle of
150	justice, which is the interest of the government; and as the government
150	must be supposed to have power, the only reasonable conclusion is, that
150	everywhere there is one principle of justice, which is the interest of
150	the stronger.
150	
150	Now I understand you, I said; and whether you are right or not I will
150	try to discover.  But let me remark, that in defining justice you have
150	yourself used the word 'interest' which you forbade me to use.  It is
150	true, however, that in your definition the words 'of the stronger' are
150	added.
150	
150	A small addition, you must allow, he said.
150	
150	Great or small, never mind about that:  we must first enquire whether
150	what you are saying is the truth.  Now we are both agreed that justice
150	is interest of some sort, but you go on to say 'of the stronger'; about
150	this addition I am not so sure, and must therefore consider further.
150	
150	Proceed.
150	
150	I will; and first tell me, Do you admit that it is just or subjects to
150	obey their rulers?
150	
150	I do.
150	
150	But are the rulers of states absolutely infallible, or are they
150	sometimes liable to err?
150	
150	To be sure, he replied, they are liable to err.
150	
150	Then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly, and
150	sometimes not?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	When they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to their
150	interest; when they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit
150	that?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects,--and
150	that is what you call justice?
150	
150	Doubtless.
150	
150	Then justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience to the
150	interest of the stronger but the reverse?
150	
150	What is that you are saying? he asked.
150	
150	I am only repeating what you are saying, I believe.  But let us
150	consider: Have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about
150	their own interest in what they command, and also that to obey them is
150	justice?  Has not that been admitted?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest
150	of the stronger, when the rulers unintentionally command things to be
150	done which are to their own injury.  For if, as you say, justice is the
150	obedience which the subject renders to their commands, in that case, O
150	wisest of men, is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker
150	are commanded to do, not what is for the interest, but what is for the
150	injury of the stronger?
150	
150	Nothing can be clearer, Socrates, said Polemarchus.
150	
150	SOCRATES - CLEITOPHON - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS
150	
150	Yes, said Cleitophon, interposing, if you are allowed to be his witness.
150	
150	But there is no need of any witness, said Polemarchus, for Thrasymachus
150	himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for
150	their own interest, and that for subjects to obey them is justice.
150	
150	Yes, Polemarchus,--Thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was
150	commanded by their rulers is just.
150	
150	Yes, Cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest of the
150	stronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further
150	acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his
150	subjects to do what is not for his own interest; whence follows that
150	justice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger.
150	
150	But, said Cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the stronger what the
150	stronger thought to be his interest,--this was what the weaker had to
150	do; and this was affirmed by him to be justice.
150	
150	Those were not his words, rejoined Polemarchus.
150	
150	SOCRATES - THRASYMACHUS
150	
150	Never mind, I replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept his
150	statement.  Tell me, Thrasymachus, I said, did you mean by justice what
150	the stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or not?
150	
150	Certainly not, he said.  Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken
150	the stronger at the time when he is mistaken?
150	
150	Yes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted that
150	the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken.
150	
150	You argue like an informer, Socrates.  Do you mean, for example, that
150	he who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is
150	mistaken? or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an
150	arithmetician or grammarian at the me when he is making the mistake, in
150	respect of the mistake?  True, we say that the physician or
150	arithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake, but this is only a way
150	of speaking; for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any other
150	person of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what his name
150	implies; they none of them err unless their skill fails them, and then
150	they cease to be skilled artists.  No artist or sage or ruler errs at
150	the time when he is what his name implies; though he is commonly said
150	to err, and I adopted the common mode of speaking.  But to be perfectly
150	accurate, since you are such a lover of accuracy, we should say that
150	the ruler, in so far as he is the ruler, is unerring, and, being
150	unerring, always commands that which is for his own interest; and the
150	subject is required to execute his commands; and therefore, as I said
150	at first and now repeat, justice is the interest of the stronger.
150	
150	Indeed, Thrasymachus, and do I really appear to you to argue like an
150	informer?
150	
150	Certainly, he replied.
150	
150	And you suppose that I ask these questions with any design of injuring
150	you in the argument?
150	
150	Nay, he replied, 'suppose' is not the word--I know it; but you will be
150	found out, and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail.
150	
150	I shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any
150	misunderstanding occurring between us in future, let me ask, in what
150	sense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were
150	saying, he being the superior, it is just that the inferior should
150	execute--is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the
150	term?
150	
150	In the strictest of all senses, he said.  And now cheat and play the
150	informer if you can; I ask no quarter at your hands.  But you never
150	will be able, never.
150	
150	And do you imagine, I said, that I am such a madman as to try and
150	cheat, Thrasymachus?  I might as well shave a lion.
150	
150	Why, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you failed.
150	
150	Enough, I said, of these civilities.  It will be better that I should
150	ask you a question:  Is the physician, taken in that strict sense of
150	which you are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money?  And
150	remember that I am now speaking of the true physician.
150	
150	A healer of the sick, he replied.
150	
150	And the pilot--that is to say, the true pilot--is he a captain of
150	sailors or a mere sailor?
150	
150	A captain of sailors.
150	
150	The circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into
150	account; neither is he to be called a sailor; the name pilot by which
150	he is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing, but is significant
150	of his skill and of his authority over the sailors.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	Now, I said, every art has an interest?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	For which the art has to consider and provide?
150	
150	Yes, that is the aim of art.
150	
150	And the interest of any art is the perfection of it--this and nothing
150	else?
150	
150	What do you mean?
150	
150	I mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the body.
150	Suppose you were to ask me whether the body is self-sufficing or has
150	wants, I should reply:  Certainly the body has wants; for the body may
150	be ill and require to be cured, and has therefore interests to which
150	the art of medicine ministers; and this is the origin and intention of
150	medicine, as you will acknowledge.  Am I not right?
150	
150	Quite right, he replied.
150	
150	But is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in any
150	quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the
150	ear fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to provide for
150	the interests of seeing and hearing--has art in itself, I say, any
150	similar liability to fault or defect, and does every art require
150	another supplementary art to provide for its interests, and that
150	another and another without end?  Or have the arts to look only after
150	their own interests?  Or have they no need either of themselves or of
150	another?--having no faults or defects, they have no need to correct
150	them, either by the exercise of their own art or of any other; they
150	have only to consider the interest of their subject-matter. For every
150	art remains pure and faultless while remaining true--that is to say,
150	while perfect and unimpaired.  Take the words in your precise sense,
150	"and tell me whether I am not right."""
150	
150	Yes, clearly.
150	
150	Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the
150	interest of the body?
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	Nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art of
150	horsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other arts
150	care for themselves, for they have no needs; they care only for that
150	which is the subject of their art?
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	But surely, Thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and rulers of
150	their own subjects?
150	
150	To this he assented with a good deal of reluctance.
150	
150	Then, I said, no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of
150	the stronger or superior, but only the interest of the subject and
150	weaker?
150	
150	He made an attempt to contest this proposition also, but finally
150	acquiesced.
150	
150	Then, I continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician,
150	considers his own good in what he prescribes, but the good of his
150	patient; for the true physician is also a ruler having the human body
150	as a subject, and is not a mere money-maker; that has been admitted?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a ruler of
150	sailors and not a mere sailor?
150	
150	That has been admitted.
150	
150	And such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest
150	of the sailor who is under him, and not for his own or the ruler's
150	interest?
150	
150	He gave a reluctant 'Yes.'
150	
150	Then, I said, Thrasymachus, there is no one in any rule who, in so far
150	as he is a ruler, considers or enjoins what is for his own interest,
150	but always what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to his
150	art; to that he looks, and that alone he considers in everything which
150	he says and does.
150	
150	When we had got to this point in the argument, and every one saw that
150	the definition of justice had been completely upset, Thrasymachus,
150	instead of replying to me, said:  Tell me, Socrates, have you got a
150	nurse?
150	
150	Why do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be
150	answering?
150	
150	Because she leaves you to snivel, and never wipes your nose: she has
150	not even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep.
150	
150	What makes you say that?  I replied.
150	
150	Because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends the
150	sheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of
150	himself or his master; and you further imagine that the rulers of
150	states, if they are true rulers, never think of their subjects as
150	sheep, and that they are not studying their own advantage day and
150	night.  Oh, no; and so entirely astray are you in your ideas about the
150	just and unjust as not even to know that justice and the just are in
150	reality another's good; that is to say, the interest of the ruler and
150	stronger, and the loss of the subject and servant; and injustice the
150	opposite; for the unjust is lord over the truly simple and just: he is
150	the stronger, and his subjects do what is for his interest, and
150	minister to his happiness, which is very far from being their own.
150	Consider further, most foolish Socrates, that the just is always a
150	loser in comparison with the unjust.  First of all, in private
150	contracts: wherever the unjust is the partner of the just you will find
150	that, when the partnership is dissolved, the unjust man has always more
150	and the just less.  Secondly, in their dealings with the State: when
150	there is an income tax, the just man will pay more and the unjust less
150	on the same amount of income; and when there is anything to be received
150	the one gains nothing and the other much.  Observe also what happens
150	when they take an office; there is the just man neglecting his affairs
150	and perhaps suffering other losses, and getting nothing out of the
150	public, because he is just; moreover he is hated by his friends and
150	acquaintance for refusing to serve them in unlawful ways.  But all this
150	is reversed in the case of the unjust man.  I am speaking, as before,
150	of injustice on a large scale in which the advantage of the unjust is
150	more apparent; and my meaning will be most clearly seen if we turn to
150	that highest form of injustice in which the criminal is the happiest of
150	men, and the sufferers or those who refuse to do injustice are the most
150	miserable--that is to say tyranny, which by fraud and force takes away
150	the property of others, not little by little but wholesale;
150	comprehending in one, things sacred as well as profane, private and
150	public; for which acts of wrong, if he were detected perpetrating any
150	one of them singly, he would be punished and incur great disgrace--they
150	who do such wrong in particular cases are called robbers of temples,
150	and man-stealers and burglars and swindlers and thieves.  But when a
150	man besides taking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of
150	them, then, instead of these names of reproach, he is termed happy and
150	blessed, not only by the citizens but by all who hear of his having
150	achieved the consummation of injustice.  For mankind censure injustice,
150	fearing that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrink
150	from committing it.  And thus, as I have shown, Socrates, injustice,
150	when on a sufficient scale, has more strength and freedom and mastery
150	than justice; and, as I said at first, justice is the interest of the
150	stronger, whereas injustice is a man's own profit and interest.
150	
150	Thrasymachus, when he had thus spoken, having, like a bathman, deluged
150	our ears with his words, had a mind to go away.  But the company would
150	not let him; they insisted that he should remain and defend his
150	position; and I myself added my own humble request that he would not
150	leave us.  Thrasymachus, I said to him, excellent man, how suggestive
150	are your remarks!  And are you going to run away before you have fairly
150	taught or learned whether they are true or not?  Is the attempt to
150	determine the way of man's life so small a matter in your eyes--to
150	determine how life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest
150	advantage?
150	
150	And do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the enquiry?
150	
150	You appear rather, I replied, to have no care or thought about us,
150	Thrasymachus--whether we live better or worse from not knowing what you
150	say you know, is to you a matter of indifference.  Prithee, friend, do
150	not keep your knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and any
150	benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded.  For my own
150	part I openly declare that I am not convinced, and that I do not
150	believe injustice to be more gainful than justice, even if uncontrolled
150	and allowed to have free play.  For, granting that there may be an
150	unjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraud or force,
150	still this does not convince me of the superior advantage of injustice,
150	and there may be others who are in the same predicament with myself.
150	Perhaps we may be wrong; if so, you in your wisdom should convince us
150	that we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice.
150	
150	And how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced
150	by what I have just said; what more can I do for you?  Would you have
150	me put the proof bodily into your souls?
150	
150	Heaven forbid!  I said; I would only ask you to be consistent; or, if
150	you change, change openly and let there be no deception.  For I must
150	remark, Thrasymachus, if you will recall what was previously said, that
150	although you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense,
150	you did not observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd; you
150	thought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view
150	to their own good, but like a mere diner or banqueter with a view to
150	the pleasures of the table; or, again, as a trader for sale in the
150	market, and not as a shepherd.  Yet surely the art of the shepherd is
150	concerned only with the good of his subjects; he has only to provide
150	the best for them, since the perfection of the art is already ensured
150	whenever all the requirements of it are satisfied.  And that was what I
150	was saying just now about the ruler.  I conceived that the art of the
150	ruler, considered as ruler, whether in a state or in private life,
150	could only regard the good of his flock or subjects; whereas you seem
150	to think that the rulers in states, that is to say, the true rulers,
150	like being in authority.
150	
150	Think!  Nay, I am sure of it.
150	
150	Then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly
150	without payment, unless under the idea that they govern for the
150	advantage not of themselves but of others?  Let me ask you a question:
150	Are not the several arts different, by reason of their each having a
150	separate function?  And, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you
150	think, that we may make a little progress.
150	
150	Yes, that is the difference, he replied.
150	
150	And each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general
150	one--medicine, for example, gives us health; navigation, safety at sea,
150	and so on?
150	
150	Yes, he said.
150	
150	And the art of payment has the special function of giving pay: but we
150	do not confuse this with other arts, any more than the art of the pilot
150	is to be confused with the art of medicine, because the health of the
150	pilot may be improved by a sea voyage.  You would not be inclined to
150	say, would you, that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we
150	are to adopt your exact use of language?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not
150	say that the art of payment is medicine?
150	
150	I should say not.
150	
150	Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a
150	man takes fees when he is engaged in healing?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	And we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially
150	confined to the art?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Then, if there be any good which all artists have in common, that is to
150	be attributed to something of which they all have the common use?
150	
150	True, he replied.
150	
150	And when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is
150	gained by an additional use of the art of pay, which is not the art
150	professed by him?
150	
150	He gave a reluctant assent to this.
150	
150	Then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their
150	respective arts.  But the truth is, that while the art of medicine
150	gives health, and the art of the builder builds a house, another art
150	attends them which is the art of pay.  The various arts may be doing
150	their own business and benefiting that over which they preside, but
150	would the artist receive any benefit from his art unless he were paid
150	as well?
150	
150	I suppose not.
150	
150	But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing?
150	
150	Certainly, he confers a benefit.
150	
150	Then now, Thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that neither arts
150	nor governments provide for their own interests; but, as we were before
150	saying, they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who
150	are the weaker and not the stronger--to their good they attend and not
150	to the good of the superior.
150	
150	And this is the reason, my dear Thrasymachus, why, as I was just now
150	saying, no one is willing to govern; because no one likes to take in
150	hand the reformation of evils which are not his concern without
150	remuneration.  For, in the execution of his work, and in giving his
150	orders to another, the true artist does not regard his own interest,
150	but always that of his subjects; and therefore in order that rulers may
150	be willing to rule, they must be paid in one of three modes of payment:
150	money, or honour, or a penalty for refusing.
150	
150	SOCRATES - GLAUCON
150	
150	What do you mean, Socrates? said Glaucon.  The first two modes of
150	payment are intelligible enough, but what the penalty is I do not
150	understand, or how a penalty can be a payment.
150	
150	You mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which to
150	the best men is the great inducement to rule?  Of course you know that
150	ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction for
150	them; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing
150	and so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves
150	out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves.  And not being
150	ambitious they do not care about honour.  Wherefore necessity must be
150	laid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear of
150	punishment.  And this, as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness
150	to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed
150	dishonourable.  Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who
150	refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself.
150	And the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office,
150	not because they would, but because they cannot help--not under the
150	idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves,
150	but as a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of
150	ruling to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good.
150	For there is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of
150	good men, then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention
150	as to obtain office is at present; then we should have plain proof that
150	the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest, but
150	that of his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose rather
150	to receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of
150	conferring one.  So far am I from agreeing with Thrasymachus that
150	justice is the interest of the stronger.  This latter question need not
150	be further discussed at present; but when Thrasymachus says that the
150	life of the unjust is more advantageous than that of the just, his new
150	statement appears to me to be of a far more serious character.  Which
150	of us has spoken truly?  And which sort of life, Glaucon, do you prefer?
150	
150	I for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous, he
150	answered.
150	
150	Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus was
150	rehearsing?
150	
150	Yes, I heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced me.
150	
150	Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that
150	he is saying what is not true?
150	
150	Most certainly, he replied.
150	
150	If, I said, he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all
150	the advantages of being just, and he answers and we rejoin, there must
150	be a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on either
150	side, and in the end we shall want judges to decide; but if we proceed
150	in our enquiry as we lately did, by making admissions to one another,
150	we shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in our own persons.
150	
150	Very good, he said.
150	
150	And which method do I understand you to prefer?  I said.
150	
150	That which you propose.
150	
150	Well, then, Thrasymachus, I said, suppose you begin at the beginning
150	and answer me.  You say that perfect injustice is more gainful than
150	perfect justice?
150	
150	SOCRATES - GLAUCON - THRASYMACHUS
150	
150	Yes, that is what I say, and I have given you my reasons.
150	
150	And what is your view about them?  Would you call one of them virtue
150	and the other vice?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	I suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice?
150	
150	What a charming notion!  So likely too, seeing that I affirm injustice
150	to be profitable and justice not.
150	
150	What else then would you say?
150	
150	The opposite, he replied.
150	
150	And would you call justice vice?
150	
150	No, I would rather say sublime simplicity.
150	
150	Then would you call injustice malignity?
150	
150	No; I would rather say discretion.
150	
150	And do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good?
150	
150	Yes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly
150	unjust, and who have the power of subduing states and nations; but
150	perhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses.
150	
150	Even this profession if undetected has advantages, though they are not
150	to be compared with those of which I was just now speaking.
150	
150	I do not think that I misapprehend your meaning, Thrasymachus, I
150	replied; but still I cannot hear without amazement that you class
150	injustice with wisdom and virtue, and justice with the opposite.
150	
150	Certainly I do so class them.
150	
150	Now, I said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable
150	ground; for if the injustice which you were maintaining to be
150	profitable had been admitted by you as by others to be vice and
150	deformity, an answer might have been given to you on received
150	principles; but now I perceive that you will call injustice honourable
150	and strong, and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualities
150	which were attributed by us before to the just, seeing that you do not
150	hesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue.
150	
150	You have guessed most infallibly, he replied.
150	
150	Then I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the
150	argument so long as I have reason to think that you, Thrasymachus, are
150	speaking your real mind; for I do believe that you are now in earnest
150	and are not amusing yourself at our expense.
150	
150	I may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you?--to refute the
150	argument is your business.
150	
150	Very true, I said; that is what I have to do:  But will you be so good
150	as answer yet one more question?  Does the just man try to gain any
150	advantage over the just?
150	
150	Far otherwise; if he did would not be the simple, amusing creature
150	which he is.
150	
150	And would he try to go beyond just action?
150	
150	He would not.
150	
150	And how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the
150	unjust; would that be considered by him as just or unjust?
150	
150	He would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but he
150	would not be able.
150	
150	Whether he would or would not be able, I said, is not to the point.  My
150	question is only whether the just man, while refusing to have more than
150	another just man, would wish and claim to have more than the unjust?
150	
150	Yes, he would.
150	
150	And what of the unjust--does he claim to have more than the just man
150	and to do more than is just.
150	
150	Of course, he said, for he claims to have more than all men.
150	
150	And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the
150	unjust man or action, in order that he may have more than all?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	We may put the matter thus, I said--the just does not desire more than
150	his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more than
150	both his like and his unlike?
150	
150	Nothing, he said, can be better than that statement.
150	
150	And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?
150	
150	Good again, he said.
150	
150	And is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them?
150	
150	Of course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like those who
150	are of a certain nature; he who is not, not.
150	
150	Each of them, I said, is such as his like is?
150	
150	Certainly, he replied.
150	
150	Very good, Thrasymachus, I said; and now to take the case of the arts:
150	you would admit that one man is a musician and another not a musician?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And which is wise and which is foolish?
150	
150	Clearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician is foolish.
150	
150	And he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he is
150	foolish?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts
150	the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the
150	tightening and loosening the strings?
150	
150	I do not think that he would.
150	
150	But he would claim to exceed the non-musician?
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	And what would you say of the physician?  In prescribing meats and
150	drinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the
150	practice of medicine?
150	
150	He would not.
150	
150	But he would wish to go beyond the non-physician?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And about knowledge and ignorance in general; see whether you think
150	that any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of
150	saying or doing more than another man who has knowledge.  Would he not
150	rather say or do the same as his like in the same case?
150	
150	That, I suppose, can hardly be denied.
150	
150	And what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have more than either
150	the knowing or the ignorant?
150	
150	I dare say.
150	
150	And the knowing is wise?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And the wise is good?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like, but
150	more than his unlike and opposite?
150	
150	I suppose so.
150	
150	Whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	But did we not say, Thrasymachus, that the unjust goes beyond both his
150	like and unlike?  Were not these your words?  They were.
150	
150	They were.
150	
150	And you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like but his
150	unlike?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Then the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil
150	and ignorant?
150	
150	That is the inference.
150	
150	And each of them is such as his like is?
150	
150	That was admitted.
150	
150	Then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil
150	and ignorant.
150	
150	Thrasymachus made all these admissions, not fluently, as I repeat them,
150	but with extreme reluctance; it was a hot summer's day, and the
150	perspiration poured from him in torrents; and then I saw what I had
150	never seen before, Thrasymachus blushing.  As we were now agreed that
150	justice was virtue and wisdom, and injustice vice and ignorance, I
150	proceeded to another point:
150	
150	Well, I said, Thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but were we not
150	also saying that injustice had strength; do you remember?
150	
150	Yes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of what you
150	are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you would be
150	quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either permit me to
150	have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will answer
150	'Very good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod 'Yes'
150	and 'No.'
150	
150	Certainly not, I said, if contrary to your real opinion.
150	
150	Yes, he said, I will, to please you, since you will not let me speak.
150	What else would you have?
150	
150	Nothing in the world, I said; and if you are so disposed I will ask and
150	you shall answer.
150	
150	Proceed.
150	
150	Then I will repeat the question which I asked before, in order that our
150	examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be
150	carried on regularly.  A statement was made that injustice is stronger
150	and more powerful than justice, but now justice, having been identified
150	with wisdom and virtue, is easily shown to be stronger than injustice,
150	if injustice is ignorance; this can no longer be questioned by any one.
150	But I want to view the matter, Thrasymachus, in a different way: You
150	would not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly
150	attempting to enslave other states, or may have already enslaved them,
150	and may be holding many of them in subjection?
150	
150	True, he replied; and I will add the best and perfectly unjust state
150	will be most likely to do so.
150	
150	I know, I said, that such was your position; but what I would further
150	consider is, whether this power which is possessed by the superior
150	state can exist or be exercised without justice.
150	
150	If you are right in you view, and justice is wisdom, then only with
150	justice; but if I am right, then without justice.
150	
150	I am delighted, Thrasymachus, to see you not only nodding assent and
150	dissent, but making answers which are quite excellent.
150	
150	That is out of civility to you, he replied.
150	
150	You are very kind, I said; and would you have the goodness also to
150	inform me, whether you think that a state, or an army, or a band of
150	robbers and thieves, or any other gang of evil-doers could act at all
150	if they injured one another?
150	
150	No indeed, he said, they could not.
150	
150	But if they abstained from injuring one another, then they might act
150	together better?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and
150	fighting, and justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true,
150	Thrasymachus?
150	
150	I agree, he said, because I do not wish to quarrel with you.
150	
150	How good of you, I said; but I should like to know also whether
150	injustice, having this tendency to arouse hatred, wherever existing,
150	among slaves or among freemen, will not make them hate one another and
150	set them at variance and render them incapable of common action?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And even if injustice be found in two only, will they not quarrel and
150	fight, and become enemies to one another and to the just.
150	
150	They will.
150	
150	And suppose injustice abiding in a single person, would your wisdom say
150	that she loses or that she retains her natural power?
150	
150	Let us assume that she retains her power.
150	
150	Yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that
150	wherever she takes up her abode, whether in a city, in an army, in a
150	family, or in any other body, that body is, to begin with, rendered
150	incapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction; and
150	does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes
150	it, and with the just?  Is not this the case?
150	
150	Yes, certainly.
150	
150	And is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person; in
150	the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not at
150	unity with himself, and in the second place making him an enemy to
150	himself and the just?  Is not that true, Thrasymachus?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And O my friend, I said, surely the gods are just?
150	
150	Granted that they are.
150	
150	But if so, the unjust will be the enemy of the gods, and the just will
150	be their friend?
150	
150	Feast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; I will not
150	oppose you, lest I should displease the company.
150	
150	Well then, proceed with your answers, and let me have the remainder of
150	my repast.  For we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser
150	and better and abler than the unjust, and that the unjust are incapable
150	of common action; nay ing at more, that to speak as we did of men who
150	are evil acting at any time vigorously together, is not strictly true,
150	for if they had been perfectly evil, they would have laid hands upon
150	one another; but it is evident that there must have been some remnant
150	of justice in them, which enabled them to combine; if there had not
150	been they would have injured one another as well as their victims; they
150	were but half--villains in their enterprises; for had they been whole
150	villains, and utterly unjust, they would have been utterly incapable of
150	action.  That, as I believe, is the truth of the matter, and not what
150	you said at first.  But whether the just have a better and happier life
150	than the unjust is a further question which we also proposed to
150	consider.  I think that they have, and for the reasons which to have
150	given; but still I should like to examine further, for no light matter
150	is at stake, nothing less than the rule of human life.
150	
150	Proceed.
150	
150	I will proceed by asking a question:  Would you not say that a horse
150	has some end?
150	
150	I should.
150	
150	And the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could
150	not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?
150	
150	I do not understand, he said.
150	
150	Let me explain:  Can you see, except with the eye?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Or hear, except with the ear?
150	
150	No.
150	
150	These then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs?
150	
150	They may.
150	
150	But you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel, and
150	in many other ways?
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	And yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the purpose?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	May we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook?
150	
150	We may.
150	
150	Then now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my
150	meaning when I asked the question whether the end of anything would be
150	that which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by
150	any other thing?
150	
150	I understand your meaning, he said, and assent.
150	
150	And that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence?  Need I
150	ask again whether the eye has an end?
150	
150	It has.
150	
150	And has not the eye an excellence?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And the ear has an end and an excellence also?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And the same is true of all other things; they have each of them an end
150	and a special excellence?
150	
150	That is so.
150	
150	Well, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their
150	own proper excellence and have a defect instead?
150	
150	How can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot see?
150	
150	You mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, which is
150	sight; but I have not arrived at that point yet.  I would rather ask
150	the question more generally, and only enquire whether the things which
150	fulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence, and fall
150	of fulfilling them by their own defect?
150	
150	Certainly, he replied.
150	
150	I might say the same of the ears; when deprived of their own proper
150	excellence they cannot fulfil their end?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And the same observation will apply to all other things?
150	
150	I agree.
150	
150	Well; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil?  for
150	example, to superintend and command and deliberate and the like.  Are
150	not these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be
150	assigned to any other?
150	
150	To no other.
150	
150	And is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?
150	
150	Assuredly, he said.
150	
150	And has not the soul an excellence also?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that
150	excellence?
150	
150	She cannot.
150	
150	Then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent,
150	and the good soul a good ruler?
150	
150	Yes, necessarily.
150	
150	And we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and
150	injustice the defect of the soul?
150	
150	That has been admitted.
150	
150	Then the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust man
150	will live ill?
150	
150	That is what your argument proves.
150	
150	And he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives ill the
150	reverse of happy?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Then the just is happy, and the unjust miserable?
150	
150	So be it.
150	
150	But happiness and not misery is profitable.
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	Then, my blessed Thrasymachus, injustice can never be more profitable
150	than justice.
150	
150	Let this, Socrates, he said, be your entertainment at the Bendidea.
150	
150	For which I am indebted to you, I said, now that you have grown gentle
150	towards me and have left off scolding.  Nevertheless, I have not been
150	well entertained; but that was my own fault and not yours.  As an
150	epicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successively brought to
150	table, he not having allowed himself time to enjoy the one before, so
150	have I gone from one subject to another without having discovered what
150	I sought at first, the nature of justice.  I left that enquiry and
150	turned away to consider whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil
150	and folly; and when there arose a further question about the
150	comparative advantages of justice and injustice, I could not refrain
150	from passing on to that.  And the result of the whole discussion has
150	been that I know nothing at all.  For I know not what justice is, and
150	therefore I am not likely to know whether it is or is not a virtue, nor
150	can I say whether the just man is happy or unhappy.
150	
150	
150	
150	
150	BOOK II
150	
150	
150	SOCRATES - GLAUCON
150	
150	WITH these words I was thinking that I had made an end of the
150	discussion; but the end, in truth, proved to be only a beginning.  For
150	Glaucon, who is always the most pugnacious of men, was dissatisfied at
150	Thrasymachus' retirement; he wanted to have the battle out.  So he said
150	to me:  Socrates, do you wish really to persuade us, or only to seem to
150	have persuaded us, that to be just is always better than to be unjust?
150	
150	I should wish really to persuade you, I replied, if I could.
150	
150	Then you certainly have not succeeded.  Let me ask you now:--How would
150	you arrange goods--are there not some which we welcome for their own
150	sakes, and independently of their consequences, as, for example,
150	harmless pleasures and enjoyments, which delight us at the time,
150	although nothing follows from them?
150	
150	I agree in thinking that there is such a class, I replied.
150	
150	Is there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, sight,
150	health, which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their
150	results?
150	
150	Certainly, I said.
150	
150	And would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and the
150	care of the sick, and the physician's art; also the various ways of
150	money-making--these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable; and
150	no one would choose them for their own sakes, but only for the sake of
150	some reward or result which flows from them?
150	
150	There is, I said, this third class also.  But why do you ask?
150	
150	Because I want to know in which of the three classes you would place
150	justice?
150	
150	In the highest class, I replied,--among those goods which he who would
150	be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their
150	results.
150	
150	Then the many are of another mind; they think that justice is to be
150	reckoned in the troublesome class, among goods which are to be pursued
150	for the sake of rewards and of reputation, but in themselves are
150	disagreeable and rather to be avoided.
150	
150	I know, I said, that this is their manner of thinking, and that this
150	was the thesis which Thrasymachus was maintaining just now, when he
150	censured justice and praised injustice.  But I am too stupid to be
150	convinced by him.
150	
150	I wish, he said, that you would hear me as well as him, and then I
150	shall see whether you and I agree.  For Thrasymachus seems to me, like
150	a snake, to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to
150	have been; but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not
150	yet been made clear.  Setting aside their rewards and results, I want
150	to know what they are in themselves, and how they inwardly work in the
150	soul.  If you, please, then, I will revive the argument of
150	Thrasymachus.  And first I will speak of the nature and origin of
150	justice according to the common view of them.  Secondly, I will show
150	that all men who practise justice do so against their will, of
150	necessity, but not as a good.  And thirdly, I will argue that there is
150	reason in this view, for the life of the unjust is after all better far
150	than the life of the just--if what they say is true, Socrates, since I
150	myself am not of their opinion.  But still I acknowledge that I am
150	perplexed when I hear the voices of Thrasymachus and myriads of others
150	dinning in my ears; and, on the other hand, I have never yet heard the
150	superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a
150	satisfactory way.  I want to hear justice praised in respect of itself;
150	then I shall be satisfied, and you are the person from whom I think
150	that I am most likely to hear this; and therefore I will praise the
150	unjust life to the utmost of my power, and my manner of speaking will
150	indicate the manner in which I desire to hear you too praising justice
150	and censuring injustice.  Will you say whether you approve of my
150	proposal?
150	
150	Indeed I do; nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of sense
150	would oftener wish to converse.
150	
150	I am delighted, he replied, to hear you say so, and shall begin by
150	speaking, as I proposed, of the nature and origin of justice.
150	
150	GLAUCON
150	
150	They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice,
150	evil; but that the evil is greater than the good.  And so when men have
150	both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not
150	being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they
150	had better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise
150	laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed
150	by them lawful and just.  This they affirm to be the origin and nature
150	of justice;--it is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which
150	is to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is
150	to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice,
150	being at a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good,
150	but as the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the inability of men
150	to do injustice.  For no man who is worthy to be called a man would
150	ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be
150	mad if he did.  Such is the received account, Socrates, of the nature
150	and origin of justice.
150	
150	Now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because
150	they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine
150	something of this kind:  having given both to the just and the unjust
150	power to do what they will, let us watch and see whither desire will
150	lead them; then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust
150	man to be proceeding along the same road, following their interest,
150	which all natures deem to be their good, and are only diverted into the
150	path of justice by the force of law.  The liberty which we are
150	supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such a
150	power as is said to have been possessed by Gyges the ancestor of
150	Croesus the Lydian.  According to the tradition, Gyges was a shepherd
150	in the service of the king of Lydia; there was a great storm, and an
150	earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was
150	feeding his flock.  Amazed at the sight, he descended into the opening,
150	where, among other marvels, he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having
150	doors, at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature,
150	as appeared to him, more than human, and having nothing on but a gold
150	ring; this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended.  Now the
150	shepherds met together, according to custom, that they might send their
150	monthly report about the flocks to the king; into their assembly he
150	came having the ring on his finger, and as he was sitting among them he
150	chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand, when instantly
150	he became invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak
150	of him as if he were no longer present.  He was astonished at this, and
150	again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared;
150	he made several trials of the ring, and always with the same
150	result-when he turned the collet inwards he became invisible, when
150	outwards he reappeared.  Whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the
150	messengers who were sent to the court; where as soon as he arrived he
150	seduced the queen, and with her help conspired against the king and
150	slew him, and took the kingdom.  Suppose now that there were two such
150	magic rings, and the just put on one of them and the unjust the other;
150	no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand
150	fast in justice.  No man would keep his hands off what was not his own
150	when he could safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into
150	houses and lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from
150	prison whom he would, and in all respects be like a God among men.
150	Then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust;
150	they would both come at last to the same point.  And this we may truly
150	affirm to be a great proof that a man is just, not willingly or because
150	he thinks that justice is any good to him individually, but of
150	necessity, for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust,
150	there he is unjust.  For all men believe in their hearts that injustice
150	is far more profitable to the individual than justice, and he who
150	argues as I have been supposing, will say that they are right.  If you
150	could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and
150	never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he would be
150	thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although they
150	would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances with
150	one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice.  Enough
150	of this.
150	
150	Now, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and
150	unjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the
150	isolation to be effected?  I answer:  Let the unjust man be entirely
150	unjust, and the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away
150	from either of them, and both are to be perfectly furnished for the
150	work of their respective lives.  First, let the unjust be like other
150	distinguished masters of craft; like the skilful pilot or physician,
150	who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits, and
150	who, if he fails at any point, is able to recover himself.  So let the
150	unjust make his unjust attempts in the right way, and lie hidden if he
150	means to be great in his injustice (he who is found out is nobody): for
150	the highest reach of injustice is: to be deemed just when you are not.
150	Therefore I say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the
150	most perfect injustice; there is to be no deduction, but we must allow
150	him, while doing the most unjust acts, to have acquired the greatest
150	reputation for justice.  If he have taken a false step he must be able
150	to recover himself; he must be one who can speak with effect, if any of
150	his deeds come to light, and who can force his way where force is
150	required his courage and strength, and command of money and friends.
150	And at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and
150	simplicity, wishing, as Aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good.
150	There must be no seeming, for if he seem to be just he will be honoured
150	and rewarded, and then we shall not know whether he is just for the
150	sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards; therefore, let
150	him be clothed in justice only, and have no other covering; and he must
150	be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former.  Let him be
150	the best of men, and let him be thought the worst; then he will have
150	been put to the proof; and we shall see whether he will be affected by
150	the fear of infamy and its consequences.  And let him continue thus to
150	the hour of death; being just and seeming to be unjust.  When both have
150	reached the uttermost extreme, the one of justice and the other of
150	injustice, let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the
150	two.
150	
150	SOCRATES - GLAUCON
150	
150	Heavens! my dear Glaucon, I said, how energetically you polish them up
150	for the decision, first one and then the other, as if they were two
150	statues.
150	
150	I do my best, he said.  And now that we know what they are like there
150	is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of
150	them.  This I will proceed to describe; but as you may think the
150	description a little too coarse, I ask you to suppose, Socrates, that
150	the words which follow are not mine.-- Let me put them into the mouths
150	of the eulogists of injustice: They will tell you that the just man who
150	is thought unjust will be scourged, racked, bound--will have his eyes
150	burnt out; and, at last, after suffering every kind of evil, he will be
150	impaled:  Then he will understand that he ought to seem only, and not
150	to be, just; the words of Aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the
150	unjust than of the just.  For the unjust is pursuing a reality; he does
150	not live with a view to appearances--he wants to be really unjust and
150	not to seem only:--
150	
150	    His mind has a soil deep and fertile,
150	    Out of which spring his prudent counsels.
150	
150	In the first place, he is thought just, and therefore bears rule in the
150	city; he can marry whom he will, and give in marriage to whom he will;
150	also he can trade and deal where he likes, and always to his own
150	advantage, because he has no misgivings about injustice and at every
150	contest, whether in public or private, he gets the better of his
150	antagonists, and gains at their expense, and is rich, and out of his
150	gains he can benefit his friends, and harm his enemies; moreover, he
150	can offer sacrifices, and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and
150	magnificently, and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to
150	honour in a far better style than the just, and therefore he is likely
150	to be dearer than they are to the gods.  And thus, Socrates, gods and
150	men are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the
150	life of the just.
150	
150	ADEIMANTUS - SOCRATES
150	
150	I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when Adeimantus, his
150	brother, interposed:  Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there
150	is nothing more to be urged?
150	
150	Why, what else is there?  I answered.
150	
150	The strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he replied.
150	
150	Well, then, according to the proverb, 'Let brother help brother'--if he
150	fails in any part do you assist him; although I must confess that
150	Glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take
150	from me the power of helping justice.
150	
150	ADEIMANTUS
150	
150	Nonsense, he replied.  But let me add something more:  There is another
150	side to Glaucon's argument about the praise and censure of justice and
150	injustice, which is equally required in order to bring out what I
150	believe to be his meaning.  Parents and tutors are always telling their
150	sons and their wards that they are to be just; but why? not for the
150	sake of justice, but for the sake of character and reputation; in the
150	hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices,
150	marriages, and the like which Glaucon has enumerated among the
150	advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice.
150	More, however, is made of appearances by this class of persons than by
150	the others; for they throw in the good opinion of the gods, and will
150	tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens, as they say, rain
150	upon the pious; and this accords with the testimony of the noble Hesiod
150	and Homer, the first of whom says, that the gods make the oaks of the
150	just--
150	
150	    To hear acorns at their summit, and bees I the middle;
150	    And the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces.
150	
150	and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them.  And
150	Homer has a very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame is--
150	
150	    As the fame of some blameless king who, like a god,
150	    Maintains justice to whom the black earth brings forth
150	    Wheat and barley, whose trees are bowed with fruit,
150	    And his sheep never fail to bear, and the sea gives him fish.
150	
150	Still grander are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son
150	vouchsafe to the just; they take them down into the world below, where
150	they have the saints lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk,
150	crowned with garlands; their idea seems to be that an immortality of
150	drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue.  Some extend their rewards
150	yet further; the posterity, as they say, of the faithful and just shall
150	survive to the third and fourth generation.  This is the style in which
150	they praise justice.  But about the wicked there is another strain;
150	they bury them in a slough in Hades, and make them carry water in a
150	sieve; also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy, and
150	inflict upon them the punishments which Glaucon described as the
150	portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust; nothing else does
150	their invention supply.  Such is their manner of praising the one and
150	censuring the other.
150	
150	Once more, Socrates, I will ask you to consider another way of speaking
150	about justice and injustice, which is not confined to the poets, but is
150	found in prose writers.  The universal voice of mankind is always
150	declaring that justice and virtue are honourable, but grievous and
150	toilsome; and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of
150	attainment, and are only censured by law and opinion.  They say also
150	that honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty; and
150	they are quite ready to call wicked men happy, and to honour them both
150	in public and private when they are rich or in any other way
150	influential, while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and
150	poor, even though acknowledging them to be better than the others.  But
150	most extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and
150	the gods: they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many
150	good men, and good and happiness to the wicked.  And mendicant prophets
150	go to rich men's doors and persuade them that they have a power
150	committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a man's own or
150	his ancestor's sins by sacrifices or charms, with rejoicings and
150	feasts; and they promise to harm an enemy, whether just or unjust, at a
150	small cost; with magic arts and incantations binding heaven, as they
150	say, to execute their will.  And the poets are the authorities to whom
150	they appeal, now smoothing the path of vice with the words of Hesiod;--
150	
150	    Vice may be had in abundance without trouble; the way is smooth
150	    and her dwelling-place is near. But before virtue the gods have
150	    set toil,
150	
150	and a tedious and uphill road:  then citing Homer as a witness that the
150	gods may be influenced by men; for he also says:
150	
150	    The gods, too, may he turned from their purpose; and men pray to
150	    them and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties,
150	    and by libations and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and
150	    transgressed.
150	
150	And they produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus, who
150	were children of the Moon and the Muses--that is what they
150	say--according to which they perform their ritual, and persuade not
150	only individuals, but whole cities, that expiations and atonements for
150	sin may be made by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour,
150	and are equally at the service of the living and the dead; the latter
150	sort they call mysteries, and they redeem us from the pains of hell,
150	but if we neglect them no one knows what awaits us.
150	
150	He proceeded:  And now when the young hear all this said about virtue
150	and vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their
150	minds likely to be affected, my dear Socrates,--those of them, I mean,
150	who are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower,
150	and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what
150	manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if
150	they would make the best of life?  Probably the youth will say to
150	himself in the words of Pindar--
150	
150	    Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier
150	    tower which may he a fortress to me all my days?
150	
150	For what men say is that, if I am really just and am not also thought
150	just profit there is none, but the pain and loss on the other hand are
150	unmistakable.  But if, though unjust, I acquire the reputation of
150	justice, a heavenly life is promised to me.  Since then, as
150	philosophers prove, appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of
150	happiness, to appearance I must devote myself.  I will describe around
150	me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of
150	my house; behind I will trail the subtle and crafty fox, as
150	Archilochus, greatest of sages, recommends.  But I hear some one
150	exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often difficult; to
150	which I answer, Nothing great is easy.  Nevertheless, the argument
150	indicates this, if we would be happy, to be the path along which we
150	should proceed.  With a view to concealment we will establish secret
150	brotherhoods and political clubs.  And there are professors of rhetoric
150	who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies; and so, partly
150	by persuasion and partly by force, I shall make unlawful gains and not
150	be punished.  Still I hear a voice saying that the gods cannot be
150	deceived, neither can they be compelled.  But what if there are no
150	gods? or, suppose them to have no care of human things--why in either
150	case should we mind about concealment?  And even if there are gods, and
150	they do care about us, yet we know of them only from tradition and the
150	genealogies of the poets; and these are the very persons who say that
150	they may be influenced and turned by 'sacrifices and soothing
150	entreaties and by offerings.' Let us be consistent then, and believe
150	both or neither.  If the poets speak truly, why then we had better be
150	unjust, and offer of the fruits of injustice; for if we are just,
150	although we may escape the vengeance of heaven, we shall lose the gains
150	of injustice; but, if we are unjust, we shall keep the gains, and by
150	our sinning and praying, and praying and sinning, the gods will be
150	propitiated, and we shall not be punished.  'But there is a world below
150	in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds.'
150	Yes, my friend, will be the reflection, but there are mysteries and
150	atoning deities, and these have great power.  That is what mighty
150	cities declare; and the children of the gods, who were their poets and
150	prophets, bear a like testimony.
150	
150	On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than
150	the worst injustice? when, if we only unite the latter with a deceitful
150	regard to appearances, we shall fare to our mind both with gods and
150	men, in life and after death, as the most numerous and the highest
150	authorities tell us.  Knowing all this, Socrates, how can a man who has
150	any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth, be willing to
150	honour justice; or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears
150	justice praised?  And even if there should be some one who is able to
150	disprove the truth of my words, and who is satisfied that justice is
150	best, still he is not angry with the unjust, but is very ready to
150	forgive them, because he also knows that men are not just of their own
150	free will; unless, peradventure, there be some one whom the divinity
150	within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice, or who has
150	attained knowledge of the truth--but no other man.  He only blames
150	injustice who, owing to cowardice or age or some weakness, has not the
150	power of being unjust.  And this is proved by the fact that when he
150	obtains the power, he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be.
150	
150	The cause of all this, Socrates, was indicated by us at the beginning
150	of the argument, when my brother and I told you how astonished we were
150	to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice--beginning
150	with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us,
150	and ending with the men of our own time--no one has ever blamed
150	injustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories,
150	honours, and benefits which flow from them.  No one has ever adequately
150	described either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either
150	of them abiding in the soul, and invisible to any human or divine eye;
150	or shown that of all the things of a man's soul which he has within
150	him, justice is the greatest good, and injustice the greatest evil.
150	Had this been the universal strain, had you sought to persuade us of
150	this from our youth upwards, we should not have been on the watch to
150	keep one another from doing wrong, but every one would have been his
150	own watchman, because afraid, if he did wrong, of harbouring in himself
150	the greatest of evils.  I dare say that Thrasymachus and others would
150	seriously hold the language which I have been merely repeating, and
150	words even stronger than these about justice and injustice, grossly, as
150	I conceive, perverting their true nature.  But I speak in this vehement
150	manner, as I must frankly confess to you, because I want to hear from
150	you the opposite side; and I would ask you to show not only the
150	superiority which justice has over injustice, but what effect they have
150	on the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other
150	an evil to him.  And please, as Glaucon requested of you, to exclude
150	reputations; for unless you take away from each of them his true
150	reputation and add on the false, we shall say that you do not praise
150	justice, but the appearance of it; we shall think that you are only
150	exhorting us to keep injustice dark, and that you really agree with
150	Thrasymachus in thinking that justice is another's good and the
150	interest of the stronger, and that injustice is a man's own profit and
150	interest, though injurious to the weaker.  Now as you have admitted
150	that justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired
150	indeed for their results, but in a far greater degree for their own
150	sakes--like sight or hearing or knowledge or health, or any other real
150	and natural and not merely conventional good--I would ask you in your
150	praise of justice to regard one point only: I mean the essential good
150	and evil which justice and injustice work in the possessors of them.
150	Let others praise justice and censure injustice, magnifying the rewards
150	and honours of the one and abusing the other; that is a manner of
150	arguing which, coming from them, I am ready to tolerate, but from you
150	who have spent your whole life in the consideration of this question,
150	unless I hear the contrary from your own lips, I expect something
150	better.  And therefore, I say, not only prove to us that justice is
150	better than injustice, but show what they either of them do to the
150	possessor of them, which makes the one to be a good and the other an
150	evil, whether seen or unseen by gods and men.
150	
150	SOCRATES - ADEIMANTUS
150	
150	I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus, but on
150	hearing these words I was quite delighted, and said: Sons of an
150	illustrious father, that was not a bad beginning of the Elegiac verses
150	which the admirer of Glaucon made in honour of you after you had
150	distinguished yourselves at the battle of Megara:--
150	
150	    'Sons of Ariston,' he sang, 'divine offspring of an
150	    illustrious hero.'
150	
150	The epithet is very appropriate, for there is something truly divine in
150	being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice,
150	and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments.  And I do believe that
150	you are not convinced--this I infer from your general character, for
150	had I judged only from your speeches I should have mistrusted you.  But
150	now, the greater my confidence in you, the greater is my difficulty in
150	knowing what to say.  For I am in a strait between two; on the one hand
150	I feel that I am unequal to the task; and my inability is brought home
150	to me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which I
150	made to Thrasymachus, proving, as I thought, the superiority which
150	justice has over injustice.  And yet I cannot refuse to help, while
150	breath and speech remain to me; I am afraid that there would be an
150	impiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting
150	up a hand in her defence.  And therefore I had best give such help as I
150	can.
150	
150	Glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question
150	drop, but to proceed in the investigation.  They wanted to arrive at
150	the truth, first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and
150	secondly, about their relative advantages.  I told them, what I really
150	thought, that the enquiry would be of a serious nature, and would
150	require very good eyes.  Seeing then, I said, that we are no great
150	wits, I think that we had better adopt a method which I may illustrate
150	thus; suppose that a short-sighted person had been asked by some one to
150	read small letters from a distance; and it occurred to some one else
150	that they might be found in another place which was larger and in which
150	the letters were larger--if they were the same and he could read the
150	larger letters first, and then proceed to the lesser--this would have
150	been thought a rare piece of good fortune.
150	
150	Very true, said Adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply to our
150	enquiry?
150	
150	I will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our
150	enquiry, is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an
150	individual, and sometimes as the virtue of a State.
150	
150	True, he replied.
150	
150	And is not a State larger than an individual?
150	
150	It is.
150	
150	Then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and
150	more easily discernible.  I propose therefore that we enquire into the
150	nature of justice and injustice, first as they appear in the State, and
150	secondly in the individual, proceeding from the greater to the lesser
150	and comparing them.
150	
150	That, he said, is an excellent proposal.
150	
150	And if we imagine the State in process of creation, we shall see the
150	justice and injustice of the State in process of creation also.
150	
150	I dare say.
150	
150	When the State is completed there may be a hope that the object of our
150	search will be more easily discovered.
150	
150	Yes, far more easily.
150	
150	But ought we to attempt to construct one?  I said; for to do so, as I
150	am inclined to think, will be a very serious task.  Reflect therefore.
150	
150	I have reflected, said Adeimantus, and am anxious that you should
150	proceed.
150	
150	A State, I said, arises, as I conceive, out of the needs of mankind; no
150	one is self-sufficing, but all of us have many wants.  Can any other
150	origin of a State be imagined?
150	
150	There can I be no other.
150	
150	Then, as we have many wants, and many persons are needed to supply
150	them, one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another; and
150	when these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation
150	the body of inhabitants is termed a State.
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	And they exchange with one another, and one gives, and another
150	receives, under the idea that the exchange will be for their good.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Then, I said, let us begin and create in idea a State; and yet the true
150	creator is necessity, who is the mother of our invention.
150	
150	Of course, he replied.
150	
150	Now the first and greatest of necessities is food, which is the
150	condition of life and existence.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	The second is a dwelling, and the third clothing and the like.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great
150	demand: We may suppose that one man is a husbandman, another a builder,
150	some one else a weaver--shall we add to them a shoemaker, or perhaps
150	some other purveyor to our bodily wants?
150	
150	Quite right.
150	
150	The barest notion of a State must include four or five men.
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	And how will they proceed?  Will each bring the result of his labours
150	into a common stock?--the individual husbandman, for example, producing
150	for four, and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in
150	the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself;
150	or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of
150	producing for them, but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food
150	in a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three-fourths of his time
150	be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no
150	partnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?
150	
150	Adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at
150	producing everything.
150	
150	Probably, I replied, that would be the better way; and when I hear you
150	say this, I am myself reminded that we are not all alike; there are
150	diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different
150	occupations.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And will you have a work better done when the workman has many
150	occupations, or when he has only one?
150	
150	When he has only one.
150	
150	Further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at
150	the right time?
150	
150	No doubt.
150	
150	For business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is
150	at leisure; but the doer must follow up what he is doing, and make the
150	business his first object.
150	
150	He must.
150	
150	And if so, we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully
150	and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is
150	natural to him and does it at the right time, and leaves other things.
150	
150	Undoubtedly..
150	
150	Then more than four citizens will be required; for the husbandman will
150	not make his own plough or mattock, or other implements of agriculture,
150	if they are to be good for anything.  Neither will the builder make his
150	tools--and he too needs many; and in like manner the weaver and
150	shoemaker.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Then carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers
150	in our little State, which is already beginning to grow?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Yet even if we add neatherds, shepherds, and other herdsmen, in order
150	that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with, and builders as well
150	as husbandmen may have draught cattle, and curriers and weavers fleeces
150	and hides,--still our State will not be very large.
150	
150	That is true; yet neither will it be a very small State which contains
150	all these.
150	
150	Then, again, there is the situation of the city--to find a place where
150	nothing need be imported is well-nigh impossible.
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	Then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the
150	required supply from another city?
150	
150	There must.
150	
150	But if the trader goes empty-handed, having nothing which they require
150	who would supply his need, he will come back empty-handed.
150	
150	That is certain.
150	
150	And therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for
150	themselves, but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate
150	those from whom their wants are supplied.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required?
150	
150	They will.
150	
150	Not to mention the importers and exporters, who are called merchants?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Then we shall want merchants?
150	
150	We shall.
150	
150	And if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful sailors will
150	also be needed, and in considerable numbers?
150	
150	Yes, in considerable numbers.
150	
150	Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?
150	To secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of our
150	principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a
150	State.
150	
150	Clearly they will buy and sell.
150	
150	Then they will need a market-place, and a money-token for purposes of
150	exchange.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Suppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some production to
150	market, and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with
150	him,--is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market-place?
150	
150	Not at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, undertake
150	the office of salesmen.  In well-ordered States they are commonly those
150	who are the weakest in bodily strength, and therefore of little use for
150	any other purpose; their duty is to be in the market, and to give money
150	in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money
150	from those who desire to buy.
150	
150	This want, then, creates a class of retail-traders in our State.  Is
150	not 'retailer' the term which is applied to those who sit in the
150	market-place engaged in buying and selling, while those who wander from
150	one city to another are called merchants?
150	
150	Yes, he said.
150	
150	And there is another class of servants, who are intellectually hardly
150	on the level of companionship; still they have plenty of bodily
150	strength for labour, which accordingly they sell, and are called, if I
150	do not mistake, hirelings, hire being the name which is given to the
150	price of their labour.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Then hirelings will help to make up our population?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And now, Adeimantus, is our State matured and perfected?
150	
150	I think so.
150	
150	Where, then, is justice, and where is injustice, and in what part of
150	the State did they spring up?
150	
150	Probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another.  cannot
150	imagine that they are more likely to be found anywhere else.
150	
150	I dare say that you are right in your suggestion, I said; we had better
150	think the matter out, and not shrink from the enquiry.
150	
150	Let us then consider, first of all, what will be their way of life, now
150	that we have thus established them.  Will they not produce corn, and
150	wine, and clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves?  And
150	when they are housed, they will work, in summer, commonly, stripped and
150	barefoot, but in winter substantially clothed and shod.  They will feed
150	on barley-meal and flour of wheat, baking and kneading them, making
150	noble cakes and loaves; these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or
150	on clean leaves, themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with
150	yew or myrtle.  And they and their children will feast, drinking of the
150	wine which they have made, wearing garlands on their heads, and hymning
150	the praises of the gods, in happy converse with one another.  And they
150	will take care that their families do not exceed their means; having an
150	eye to poverty or war.
150	
150	SOCRATES - GLAUCON
150	
150	But, said Glaucon, interposing, you have not given them a relish to
150	their meal.
150	
150	True, I replied, I had forgotten; of course they must have a
150	relish-salt, and olives, and cheese, and they will boil roots and herbs
150	such as country people prepare; for a dessert we shall give them figs,
150	and peas, and beans; and they will roast myrtle-berries and acorns at
150	the fire, drinking in moderation.  And with such a diet they may be
150	expected to live in peace and health to a good old age, and bequeath a
150	similar life to their children after them.
150	
150	Yes, Socrates, he said, and if you were providing for a city of pigs,
150	how else would you feed the beasts?
150	
150	But what would you have, Glaucon?  I replied.
150	
150	Why, he said, you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life.
150	People who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas, and
150	dine off tables, and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern
150	style.
150	
150	Yes, I said, now I understand:  the question which you would have me
150	consider is, not only how a State, but how a luxurious State is
150	created; and possibly there is no harm in this, for in such a State we
150	shall be more likely to see how justice and injustice originate.  In my
150	opinion the true and healthy constitution of the State is the one which
150	I have described.  But if you wish also to see a State at fever heat, I
150	have no objection.  For I suspect that many will not be satisfied with
150	the simpler way of way They will be for adding sofas, and tables, and
150	other furniture; also dainties, and perfumes, and incense, and
150	courtesans, and cakes, all these not of one sort only, but in every
150	variety; we must go beyond the necessaries of which I was at first
150	speaking, such as houses, and clothes, and shoes: the arts of the
150	painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion, and gold and
150	ivory and all sorts of materials must be procured.
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	Then we must enlarge our borders; for the original healthy State is no
150	longer sufficient.  Now will the city have to fill and swell with a
150	multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want; such
150	as the whole tribe of hunters and actors, of whom one large class have
150	to do with forms and colours; another will be the votaries of
150	music--poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists, players,
150	dancers, contractors; also makers of divers kinds of articles,
150	including women's dresses.  And we shall want more servants.  Will not
150	tutors be also in request, and nurses wet and dry, tirewomen and
150	barbers, as well as confectioners and cooks; and swineherds, too, who
150	were not needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our
150	State, but are needed now?  They must not be forgotten:  and there will
150	be animals of many other kinds, if people eat them.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians
150	than before?
150	
150	Much greater.
150	
150	And the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants
150	will be too small now, and not enough?
150	
150	Quite true.
150	
150	Then a slice of our neighbours' land will be wanted by us for pasture
150	and tillage, and they will want a slice of ours, if, like ourselves,
150	they exceed the limit of necessity, and give themselves up to the
150	unlimited accumulation of wealth?
150	
150	That, Socrates, will be inevitable.
150	
150	And so we shall go to war, Glaucon.  Shall we not?
150	
150	Most certainly, he replied.
150	
150	Then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm, thus
150	much we may affirm, that now we have discovered war to be derived from
150	causes which are also the causes of almost all the evils in States,
150	private as well as public.
150	
150	Undoubtedly.
150	
150	And our State must once more enlarge; and this time the will be nothing
150	short of a whole army, which will have to go out and fight with the
150	invaders for all that we have, as well as for the things and persons
150	whom we were describing above.
150	
150	Why? he said; are they not capable of defending themselves?
150	
150	No, I said; not if we were right in the principle which was
150	acknowledged by all of us when we were framing the State: the
150	principle, as you will remember, was that one man cannot practise many
150	arts with success.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	But is not war an art?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking?
150	
150	Quite true.
150	
150	And the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be husbandman, or a weaver,
150	a builder--in order that we might have our shoes well made; but to him
150	and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by
150	nature fitted, and at that he was to continue working all his life long
150	and at no other; he was not to let opportunities slip, and then he
150	would become a good workman.  Now nothing can be more important than
150	that the work of a soldier should be well done.  But is war an art so
150	easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman,
150	or shoemaker, or other artisan; although no one in the world would be a
150	good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a
150	recreation, and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to this
150	and nothing else?
150	
150	No tools will make a man a skilled workman, or master of defence, nor
150	be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them, and has
150	never bestowed any attention upon them.  How then will he who takes up
150	a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day,
150	whether with heavy-armed or any other kind of troops?
150	
150	Yes, he said, the tools which would teach men their own use would be
150	beyond price.
150	
150	And the higher the duties of the guardian, I said, the more time, and
150	skill, and art, and application will be needed by him?
150	
150	No doubt, he replied.
150	
150	Will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted
150	for the task of guarding the city?
150	
150	It will.
150	
150	And the selection will be no easy matter, I said; but we must be brave
150	and do our best.
150	
150	We must.
150	
150	Is not the noble youth very like a well-bred dog in respect of guarding
150	and watching?
150	
150	What do you mean?
150	
150	I mean that both of them ought to be quick to see, and swift to
150	overtake the enemy when they see him; and strong too if, when they have
150	caught him, they have to fight with him.
150	
150	All these qualities, he replied, will certainly be required by them.
150	
150	Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog or
150	any other animal?  Have you never observed how invincible and
150	unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of
150	any creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable?
150	
150	I have.
150	
150	Then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are
150	required in the guardian.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And also of the mental ones; his soul is to be full of spirit?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	But are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another,
150	and with everybody else?
150	
150	A difficulty by no means easy to overcome, he replied.
150	
150	Whereas, I said, they ought to be dangerous to their enemies, and
150	gentle to their friends; if not, they will destroy themselves without
150	waiting for their enemies to destroy them.
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	What is to be done then?  I said; how shall we find a gentle nature
150	which has also a great spirit, for the one is the contradiction of the
150	other?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	He will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two
150	qualities; and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible;
150	and hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible.
150	
150	I am afraid that what you say is true, he replied.
150	
150	Here feeling perplexed I began to think over what had preceded.  My
150	friend, I said, no wonder that we are in a perplexity; for we have lost
150	sight of the image which we had before us.
150	
150	What do you mean? he said.
150	
150	I mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite
150	qualities.
150	
150	And where do you find them?
150	
150	Many animals, I replied, furnish examples of them; our friend the dog
150	is a very good one:  you know that well-bred dogs are perfectly gentle
150	to their familiars and acquaintances, and the reverse to strangers.
150	
150	Yes, I know.
150	
150	Then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our
150	finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Would not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited
150	nature, need to have the qualities of a philosopher?
150	
150	I do not apprehend your meaning.
150	
150	The trait of which I am speaking, I replied, may be also seen in the
150	dog, and is remarkable in the animal.
150	
150	What trait?
150	
150	Why, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an
150	acquaintance, he welcomes him, although the one has never done him any
150	harm, nor the other any good.  Did this never strike you as curious?
150	
150	The matter never struck me before; but I quite recognise the truth of
150	your remark.
150	
150	And surely this instinct of the dog is very charming;--your dog is a
150	true philosopher.
150	
150	Why?
150	
150	Why, because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only
150	by the criterion of knowing and not knowing.  And must not an animal be
150	a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the
150	test of knowledge and ignorance?
150	
150	Most assuredly.
150	
150	And is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?
150	
150	They are the same, he replied.
150	
150	And may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely to be
150	gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of
150	wisdom and knowledge?
150	
150	That we may safely affirm.
150	
150	Then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the State will
150	require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and
150	strength?
150	
150	Undoubtedly.
150	
150	Then we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found
150	them, how are they to be reared and educated?  Is not this enquiry
150	which may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is
150	our final end--How do justice and injustice grow up in States? for we
150	do not want either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the
150	argument to an inconvenient length.
150	
150	SOCRATES - ADEIMANTUS
150	
150	Adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us.
150	
150	Then, I said, my dear friend, the task must not be given up, even if
150	somewhat long.
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Come then, and let us pass a leisure hour in story-telling, and our
150	story shall be the education of our heroes.
150	
150	By all means.
150	
150	And what shall be their education?  Can we find a better than the
150	traditional sort?--and this has two divisions, gymnastic for the body,
150	and music for the soul.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Shall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?
150	
150	By all means.
150	
150	And when you speak of music, do you include literature or not?
150	
150	I do.
150	
150	And literature may be either true or false?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with the
150	false?
150	
150	I do not understand your meaning, he said.
150	
150	You know, I said, that we begin by telling children stories which,
150	though not wholly destitute of truth, are in the main fictitious; and
150	these stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn
150	gymnastics.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	That was my meaning when I said that we must teach music before
150	gymnastics.
150	
150	Quite right, he said.
150	
150	You know also that the beginning is the most important part of any
150	work, especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is
150	the time at which the character is being formed and the desired
150	impression is more readily taken.
150	
150	Quite true.
150	
150	And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales
150	which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds
150	ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish
150	them to have when they are grown up?
150	
150	We cannot.
150	
150	Then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers
150	of fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is
150	good, and reject the bad; and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell
150	their children the authorised ones only.  Let them fashion the mind
150	with such tales, even more fondly than they mould the body with their
150	hands; but most of those which are now in use must be discarded.
150	
150	Of what tales are you speaking? he said.
150	
150	You may find a model of the lesser in the greater, I said; for they are
150	necessarily of the same type, and there is the same spirit in both of
150	them.
150	
150	Very likely, he replied; but I do not as yet know what you would term
150	the greater.
150	
150	Those, I said, which are narrated by Homer and Hesiod, and the rest of
150	the poets, who have ever been the great story-tellers of mankind.
150	
150	But which stories do you mean, he said; and what fault do you find with
150	them?
150	
150	A fault which is most serious, I said; the fault of telling a lie, and,
150	what is more, a bad lie.
150	
150	But when is this fault committed?
150	
150	Whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and
150	heroes,--as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a
150	likeness to the original.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blamable; but what
150	are the stories which you mean?
150	
150	First of all, I said, there was that greatest of all lies, in high
150	places, which the poet told about Uranus, and which was a bad lie
150	too,--I mean what Hesiod says that Uranus did, and how Cronus
150	retaliated on him.  The doings of Cronus, and the sufferings which in
150	turn his son inflicted upon him, even if they were true, ought
150	certainly not to be lightly told to young and thoughtless persons; if
150	possible, they had better be buried in silence.  But if there is an
150	absolute necessity for their mention, a chosen few might hear them in a
150	mystery, and they should sacrifice not a common [Eleusinian] pig, but
150	some huge and unprocurable victim; and then the number of the hearers
150	will be very few indeed.
150	
150	Why, yes, said he, those stories are extremely objectionable.
150	
150	Yes, Adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our State; the
150	young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he
150	is far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises
150	his father when does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be
150	following the example of the first and greatest among the gods.
150	
150	I entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories are
150	quite unfit to be repeated.
150	
150	Neither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of
150	quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest, should any
150	word be said to them of the wars in heaven, and of the plots and
150	fightings of the gods against one another, for they are not true.  No,
150	we shall never mention the battles of the giants, or let them be
150	embroidered on garments; and we shall be silent about the innumerable
150	other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives.  If
150	they would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling is
150	unholy, and that never up to this time has there been any, quarrel
150	between citizens; this is what old men and old women should begin by
150	telling children; and when they grow up, the poets also should be told
150	to compose for them in a similar spirit.  But the narrative of
150	Hephaestus binding Here his mother, or how on another occasion Zeus
150	sent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten, and all
150	the battles of the gods in Homer--these tales must not be admitted into
150	our State, whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or
150	not.  For a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is
150	literal; anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely
150	to become indelible and unalterable; and therefore it is most important
150	that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous
150	thoughts.
150	
150	There you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are such
150	models to be found and of what tales are you speaking--how shall we
150	answer him?
150	
150	I said to him, You and I, Adeimantus, at this moment are not poets, but
150	founders of a State:  now the founders of a State ought to know the
150	general forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the limits
150	which must be observed by them, but to make the tales is not their
150	business.
150	
150	Very true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which you mean?
150	
150	Something of this kind, I replied:--God is always to be represented as
150	he truly is, whatever be the sort of poetry, epic, lyric or tragic, in
150	which the representation is given.
150	
150	Right.
150	
150	And is he not truly good? and must he not be represented as such?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And no good thing is hurtful?
150	
150	No, indeed.
150	
150	And that which is not hurtful hurts not?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	And that which hurts not does no evil?
150	
150	No.
150	
150	And can that which does no evil be a cause of evil?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	And the good is advantageous?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And therefore the cause of well-being?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	It follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things, but
150	of the good only?
150	
150	Assuredly.
150	
150	Then God, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many
150	assert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most
150	things that occur to men.  For few are the goods of human life, and
150	many are the evils, and the good is to be attributed to God alone; of
150	the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere, and not in him.
150	
150	That appears to me to be most true, he said.
150	
150	Then we must not listen to Homer or to any other poet who is guilty of
150	the folly of saying that two casks
150	
150	    Lie at the threshold of Zeus, full of lots, one of good,
150	    the other of evil lots,
150	
150	and that he to whom Zeus gives a mixture of the two
150	
150	    Sometimes meets with evil fortune, at other times with good;
150	
150	but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill,
150	
150	    Him wild hunger drives o'er the beauteous earth.
150	
150	And again
150	
150	    Zeus, who is the dispenser of good and evil to us.
150	
150	And if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties, which
150	was really the work of Pandarus, was brought about by Athene and Zeus,
150	or that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by Themis
150	and Zeus, he shall not have our approval; neither will we allow our
150	young men to hear the words of Aeschylus, that
150	
150	    God plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to
150	    destroy a house.
150	
150	And if a poet writes of the sufferings of Niobe--the subject of the
150	tragedy in which these iambic verses occur--or of the house of Pelops,
150	or of the Trojan war or on any similar theme, either we must not permit
150	him to say that these are the works of God, or if they are of God, he
150	must devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking; he must
150	say that God did what was just and right, and they were the better for
150	being punished; but that those who are punished are miserable, and that
150	God is the author of their misery--the poet is not to be permitted to
150	say; though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they
150	require to be punished, and are benefited by receiving punishment from
150	God; but that God being good is the author of evil to any one is to be
150	strenuously denied, and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or
150	prose by any one whether old or young in any well-ordered commonwealth.
150	Such a fiction is suicidal, ruinous, impious.
150	
150	I agree with you, he replied, and am ready to give my assent to the law.
150	
150	Let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods,
150	to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform--that God
150	is not the author of all things, but of good only.
150	
150	That will do, he said.
150	
150	And what do you think of a second principle?  Shall I ask you whether
150	God is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one
150	shape, and now in another--sometimes himself changing and passing into
150	many forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such
150	transformations; or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own
150	proper image?
150	
150	I cannot answer you, he said, without more thought.
150	
150	Well, I said; but if we suppose a change in anything, that change must
150	be effected either by the thing itself, or by some other thing?
150	
150	Most certainly.
150	
150	And things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered
150	or discomposed; for example, when healthiest and strongest, the human
150	frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks, and the plant
150	which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the
150	heat of the sun or any similar causes.
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	And will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged
150	by any external influence?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And the same principle, as I should suppose, applies to all composite
150	things--furniture, houses, garments; when good and well made, they are
150	least altered by time and circumstances.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Then everything which is good, whether made by art or nature, or both,
150	is least liable to suffer change from without?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	But surely God and the things of God are in every way perfect?
150	
150	Of course they are.
150	
150	Then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many
150	shapes?
150	
150	He cannot.
150	
150	But may he not change and transform himself?
150	
150	Clearly, he said, that must be the case if he is changed at all.
150	
150	And will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for the
150	worse and more unsightly?
150	
150	If he change at all he can only change for the worse, for we cannot
150	suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty.
150	
150	Very true, Adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether God or man,
150	desire to make himself worse?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	Then it is impossible that God should ever be willing to change; being,
150	as is supposed, the fairest and best that is conceivable, every god
150	remains absolutely and for ever in his own form.
150	
150	That necessarily follows, he said, in my judgment.
150	
150	Then, I said, my dear friend, let none of the poets tell us that
150	
150	    The gods, taking the disguise of strangers from other lands,
150	    walk up and down cities in all sorts of forms;
150	
150	and let no one slander Proteus and Thetis, neither let any one, either
150	in tragedy or in any other kind of poetry, introduce Here disguised in
150	the likeness of a priestess asking an alms
150	
150	    For the life-giving daughters of Inachus the river of Argos;
150	
150	--let us have no more lies of that sort.  Neither must we have mothers
150	under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad
150	version of these myths--telling how certain gods, as they say, 'Go
150	about by night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers
150	forms'; but let them take heed lest they make cowards of their
150	children, and at the same time speak blasphemy against the gods.
150	
150	Heaven forbid, he said.
150	
150	But although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by witchcraft
150	and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms?
150	
150	Perhaps, he replied.
150	
150	Well, but can you imagine that God will be willing to lie, whether in
150	word or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself?
150	
150	I cannot say, he replied.
150	
150	Do you not know, I said, that the true lie, if such an expression may
150	be allowed, is hated of gods and men?
150	
150	What do you mean? he said.
150	
150	I mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest
150	and highest part of himself, or about the truest and highest matters;
150	there, above all, he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him.
150	
150	Still, he said, I do not comprehend you.
150	
150	The reason is, I replied, that you attribute some profound meaning to
150	my words; but I am only saying that deception, or being deceived or
150	uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of
150	themselves, which is the soul, and in that part of them to have and to
150	hold the lie, is what mankind least like;--that, I say, is what they
150	utterly detest.
150	
150	There is nothing more hateful to them.
150	
150	And, as I was just now remarking, this ignorance in the soul of him who
150	is deceived may be called the true lie; for the lie in words is only a
150	kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the
150	soul, not pure unadulterated falsehood.  Am I not right?
150	
150	Perfectly right.
150	
150	The true lie is hated not only by the gods, but also by men?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful; in
150	dealing with enemies--that would be an instance; or again, when those
150	whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to
150	do some harm, then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or
150	preventive; also in the tales of mythology, of which we were just now
150	speaking--because we do not know the truth about ancient times, we make
150	falsehood as much like truth as we can, and so turn it to account.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	But can any of these reasons apply to God?  Can we suppose that he is
150	ignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to invention?
150	
150	That would be ridiculous, he said.
150	
150	Then the lying poet has no place in our idea of God?
150	
150	I should say not.
150	
150	Or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies?
150	
150	That is inconceivable.
150	
150	But he may have friends who are senseless or mad?
150	
150	But no mad or senseless person can be a friend of God.
150	
150	Then no motive can be imagined why God should lie?
150	
150	None whatever.
150	
150	Then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Then is God perfectly simple and true both in word and deed; he changes
150	not; he deceives not, either by sign or word, by dream or waking vision.
150	
150	Your thoughts, he said, are the reflection of my own.
150	
150	You agree with me then, I said, that this is the second type or form in
150	which we should write and speak about divine things.  The gods are not
150	magicians who transform themselves, neither do they deceive mankind in
150	any way.
150	
150	I grant that.
150	
150	Then, although we are admirers of Homer, we do not admire the lying
150	dream which Zeus sends to Agamemnon; neither will we praise the verses
150	of Aeschylus in which Thetis says that Apollo at her nuptials
150	
150	    Was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were
150	    to be long, and to know no sickness. And when he had
150	    spoken of my lot as in all things blessed of heaven he
150	    raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul. And I
150	    thought that the word of Phoebus being divine and full
150	    of prophecy, would not fail. And now he himself who
150	    uttered the strain, he who was present at the banquet,
150	    and who said this--he it is who has slain my son.
150	
150	These are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our
150	anger; and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus; neither shall
150	we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young,
150	meaning, as we do, that our guardians, as far as men can be, should be
150	true worshippers of the gods and like them.
150	
150	I entirely agree, be said, in these principles, and promise to make
150	them my laws.
150	
150	
150	
150	
150	BOOK III
150	
150	
150	SOCRATES - ADEIMANTUS
150	
150	SUCH then, I said, are our principles of theology--some tales are to be
150	told, and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth
150	upwards, if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents, and to
150	value friendship with one another.
150	
150	Yes; and I think that our principles are right, he said.
150	
150	But if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other lessons
150	besides these, and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of
150	death?  Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him?
150	
150	Certainly not, he said.
150	
150	And can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle
150	rather than defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be real
150	and terrible?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	Then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales
150	as well as over the others, and beg them not simply to but rather to
150	commend the world below, intimating to them that their descriptions are
150	untrue, and will do harm to our future warriors.
150	
150	That will be our duty, he said.
150	
150	Then, I said, we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages,
150	beginning with the verses,
150	
150	    I would rather he a serf on the land of a poor and portionless
150	    man than rule over all the dead who have come to nought.
150	
150	We must also expunge the verse, which tells us how Pluto feared,
150	
150	    Lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should
150	    be seen both of mortals and immortals.
150	
150	And again:
150	
150	    O heavens! verily in the house of Hades there is soul and
150	    ghostly form but no mind at all!
150	
150	Again of Tiresias:--
150	
150	    [To him even after death did Persephone grant mind,] that he
150	    alone should be wise; but the other souls are flitting shades.
150	
150	Again:--
150	
150	    The soul flying from the limbs had gone to Hades, lamentng her
150	    fate, leaving manhood and youth.
150	
150	Again:--
150	
150	    And the soul, with shrilling cry, passed like smoke beneath the
150	    earth.
150	
150	And,--
150	
150	    As bats in hollow of mystic cavern, whenever any of the has
150	    dropped out of the string and falls from the rock, fly shrilling
150	    and cling to one another, so did they with shrilling cry hold
150	    together as they moved.
150	
150	And we must beg Homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike
150	out these and similar passages, not because they are unpoetical, or
150	unattractive to the popular ear, but because the greater the poetical
150	charm of them, the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who
150	are meant to be free, and who should fear slavery more than death.
150	
150	Undoubtedly.
150	
150	Also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names
150	describe the world below--Cocytus and Styx, ghosts under the earth, and
150	sapless shades, and any similar words of which the very mention causes
150	a shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them.  I do
150	not say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind;
150	but there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered
150	too excitable and effeminate by them.
150	
150	There is a real danger, he said.
150	
150	Then we must have no more of them.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us.
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	And shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous
150	men?
150	
150	They will go with the rest.
150	
150	But shall we be right in getting rid of them?  Reflect:  our principle
150	is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good
150	man who is his comrade.
150	
150	Yes; that is our principle.
150	
150	And therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he
150	had suffered anything terrible?
150	
150	He will not.
150	
150	Such an one, as we further maintain, is sufficient for himself and his
150	own happiness, and therefore is least in need of other men.
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	And for this reason the loss of a son or brother, or the deprivation of
150	fortune, is to him of all men least terrible.
150	
150	Assuredly.
150	
150	And therefore he will be least likely to lament, and will bear with the
150	greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him.
150	
150	Yes, he will feel such a misfortune far less than another.
150	
150	Then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous
150	men, and making them over to women (and not even to women who are good
150	for anything), or to men of a baser sort, that those who are being
150	educated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the
150	like.
150	
150	That will be very right.
150	
150	Then we will once more entreat Homer and the other poets not to depict
150	Achilles, who is the son of a goddess, first lying on his side, then on
150	his back, and then on his face; then starting up and sailing in a
150	frenzy along the shores of the barren sea; now taking the sooty ashes
150	in both his hands and pouring them over his head, or weeping and
150	wailing in the various modes which Homer has delineated.  Nor should he
150	describe Priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching,
150	
150	    Rolling in the dirt, calling each man loudly by his name.
150	
150	Still more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce
150	the gods lamenting and saying,
150	
150	    Alas! my misery! Alas! that I bore the harvest to my sorrow.
150	
150	But if he must introduce the gods, at any rate let him not dare so
150	completely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods, as to make him
150	say--
150	
150	    O heavens! with my eyes verily I behold a dear friend of mine
150	    chased round and round the city, and my heart is sorrowful.
150	
150	Or again:--
150	
150	    Woe is me that I am fated to have Sarpedon, dearest of men to
150	    me, subdued at the hands of Patroclus the son of Menoetius.
150	
150	For if, my sweet Adeimantus, our youth seriously listen to such
150	unworthy representations of the gods, instead of laughing at them as
150	they ought, hardly will any of them deem that he himself, being but a
150	man, can be dishonoured by similar actions; neither will he rebuke any
150	inclination which may arise in his mind to say and do the like.  And
150	instead of having any shame or self-control, he will be always whining
150	and lamenting on slight occasions.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that is most true.
150	
150	Yes, I replied; but that surely is what ought not to be, as the
150	argument has just proved to us; and by that proof we must abide until
150	it is disproved by a better.
150	
150	It ought not to be.
150	
150	Neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter.  For a fit of
150	laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a
150	violent reaction.
150	
150	So I believe.
150	
150	Then persons of worth, even if only mortal men, must not be represented
150	as overcome by laughter, and still less must such a representation of
150	the gods be allowed.
150	
150	Still less of the gods, as you say, he replied.
150	
150	Then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods
150	as that of Homer when he describes how
150	
150	    Inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods, when
150	    they saw Hephaestus bustling about the mansion.
150	
150	On your views, we must not admit them.
150	
150	On my views, if you like to father them on me; that we must not admit
150	them is certain.
150	
150	Again, truth should be highly valued; if, as we were saying, a lie is
150	useless to the gods, and useful only as a medicine to men, then the use
150	of such medicines should be restricted to physicians; private
150	individuals have no business with them.
150	
150	Clearly not, he said.
150	
150	Then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying, the rulers of
150	the State should be the persons; and they, in their dealings either
150	with enemies or with their own citizens, may be allowed to lie for the
150	public good.  But nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind;
150	and although the rulers have this privilege, for a private man to lie
150	to them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the
150	patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his
150	own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer, or for a
150	sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the
150	rest of the crew, and how things are going with himself or his fellow
150	sailors.
150	
150	Most true, he said.
150	
150	If, then, the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the State,
150	
150	    Any of the craftsmen, whether he priest or physician or
150	    carpenter.
150	
150	he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally
150	subversive and destructive of ship or State.
150	
150	Most certainly, he said, if our idea of the State is ever carried out.
150	
150	In the next place our youth must be temperate?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Are not the chief elements of temperance, speaking generally, obedience
150	to commanders and self-control in sensual pleasures?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Then we shall approve such language as that of Diomede in Homer,
150	
150	    Friend, sit still and obey my word,
150	
150	and the verses which follow,
150	
150	    The Greeks marched breathing prowess,
150	    ...in silent awe of their leaders,
150	
150	and other sentiments of the same kind.
150	
150	We shall.
150	
150	What of this line,
150	
150	    O heavy with wine, who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a
150	    stag,
150	
150	and of the words which follow?  Would you say that these, or any
150	similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address
150	to their rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?
150	
150	They are ill spoken.
150	
150	They may very possibly afford some amusement, but they do not conduce
150	to temperance.  And therefore they are likely to do harm to our young
150	men--you would agree with me there?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And then, again, to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his
150	opinion is more glorious than
150	
150	    When the tables are full of bread and meat, and the cup-bearer
150	    carries round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into
150	    the cups,
150	
150	is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such
150	words?  Or the verse
150	
150	    The saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger?
150	
150	What would you say again to the tale of Zeus, who, while other gods and
150	men were asleep and he the only person awake, lay devising plans, but
150	forgot them all in a moment through his lust, and was so completely
150	overcome at the sight of Here that he would not even go into the hut,
150	but wanted to lie with her on the ground, declaring that he had never
150	been in such a state of rapture before, even when they first met one
150	another
150	
150	    Without the knowledge of their parents;
150	
150	or that other tale of how Hephaestus, because of similar goings on,
150	cast a chain around Ares and Aphrodite?
150	
150	Indeed, he said, I am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear
150	that sort of thing.
150	
150	But any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men, these
150	they ought to see and hear; as, for example, what is said in the verses,
150	
150	    He smote his breast, and thus reproached his heart,
150	    Endure, my heart; far worse hast thou endured!
150	
150	Certainly, he said.
150	
150	In the next place, we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers
150	of money.
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Neither must we sing to them of
150	
150	    Gifts persuading gods, and persuading reverend kings.
150	
150	Neither is Phoenix, the tutor of Achilles, to be approved or deemed to
150	have given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take
150	the gifts of the Greeks and assist them; but that without a gift he
150	should not lay aside his anger.  Neither will we believe or acknowledge
150	Achilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took
150	Agamemnon's or that when he had received payment he restored the dead
150	body of Hector, but that without payment he was unwilling to do so.
150	
150	Undoubtedly, he said, these are not sentiments which can be approved.
150	
150	Loving Homer as I do, I hardly like to say that in attributing these
150	feelings to Achilles, or in believing that they are truly to him, he is
150	guilty of downright impiety.  As little can I believe the narrative of
150	his insolence to Apollo, where he says,
150	
150	    Thou hast wronged me, O far-darter, most abominable of deities.
150	    Verily I would he even with thee, if I had only the power,
150	
150	or his insubordination to the river-god, on whose divinity he is ready
150	to lay hands; or his offering to the dead Patroclus of his own hair,
150	which had been previously dedicated to the other river-god Spercheius,
150	and that he actually performed this vow; or that he dragged Hector
150	round the tomb of Patroclus, and slaughtered the captives at the pyre;
150	of all this I cannot believe that he was guilty, any more than I can
150	allow our citizens to believe that he, the wise Cheiron's pupil, the
150	son of a goddess and of Peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in
150	descent from Zeus, was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time
150	the slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions, meanness, not
150	untainted by avarice, combined with overweening contempt of gods and
150	men.
150	
150	You are quite right, he replied.
150	
150	And let us equally refuse to believe, or allow to be repeated, the tale
150	of Theseus son of Poseidon, or of Peirithous son of Zeus, going forth
150	as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape; or of any other hero or son of
150	a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely
150	ascribe to them in our day: and let us further compel the poets to
150	declare either that these acts were not done by them, or that they were
150	not the sons of gods;--both in the same breath they shall not be
150	permitted to affirm.  We will not have them trying to persuade our
150	youth that the gods are the authors of evil, and that heroes are no
150	better than men-sentiments which, as we were saying, are neither pious
150	nor true, for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the
150	gods.
150	
150	Assuredly not.
150	
150	And further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear
150	them; for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is
150	convinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by--
150	
150	    The kindred of the gods, the relatives of Zeus, whose ancestral
150	    altar, the attar of Zeus, is aloft in air on the peak of Ida,
150	
150	and who have
150	
150	    the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins.
150	
150	And therefore let us put an end to such tales, lest they engender
150	laxity of morals among the young.
150	
150	By all means, he replied.
150	
150	But now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not
150	to be spoken of, let us see whether any have been omitted by us.  The
150	manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should
150	be treated has been already laid down.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And what shall we say about men?  That is clearly the remaining portion
150	of our subject.
150	
150	Clearly so.
150	
150	But we are not in a condition to answer this question at present, my
150	friend.
150	
150	Why not?
150	
150	Because, if I am not mistaken, we shall have to say that about men
150	poets and story-tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements
150	when they tell us that wicked men are often happy, and the good
150	miserable; and that injustice is profitable when undetected, but that
150	justice is a man's own loss and another's gain--these things we shall
150	forbid them to utter, and command them to sing and say the opposite.
150	
150	To be sure we shall, he replied.
150	
150	But if you admit that I am right in this, then I shall maintain that
150	you have implied the principle for which we have been all along
150	contending.
150	
150	I grant the truth of your inference.
150	
150	That such things are or are not to be said about men is a question
150	which we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is, and
150	how naturally advantageous to the possessor, whether he seems to be
150	just or not.
150	
150	Most true, he said.
150	
150	Enough of the subjects of poetry:  let us now speak of the style; and
150	when this has been considered, both matter and manner will have been
150	completely treated.
150	
150	I do not understand what you mean, said Adeimantus.
150	
150	Then I must make you understand; and perhaps I may be more intelligible
150	if I put the matter in this way.  You are aware, I suppose, that all
150	mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or
150	to come?
150	
150	Certainly, he replied.
150	
150	And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union
150	of the two?
150	
150	That again, he said, I do not quite understand.
150	
150	I fear that I must be a ridiculous teacher when I have so much
150	difficulty in making myself apprehended.  Like a bad speaker,
150	therefore, I will not take the whole of the subject, but will break a
150	piece off in illustration of my meaning.  You know the first lines of
150	the Iliad, in which the poet says that Chryses prayed Agamemnon to
150	release his daughter, and that Agamemnon flew into a passion with him;
150	whereupon Chryses, failing of his object, invoked the anger of the God
150	against the Achaeans.  Now as far as these lines,
150	
150	    And he prayed all the Greeks, but especially the two sons of Atreus,
150	    the chiefs of the people,
150	
150	the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose
150	that he is any one else.  But in what follows he takes the person of
150	Chryses, and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the
150	speaker is not Homer, but the aged priest himself.  And in this double
150	form he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at
150	Troy and in Ithaca and throughout the Odyssey.
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites
150	from time to time and in the intermediate passages?
150	
150	Quite true.
150	
150	But when the poet speaks in the person of another, may we not say that
150	he assimilates his style to that of the person who, as he informs you,
150	is going to speak?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice
150	or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes?
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by
150	way of imitation?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then
150	again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple
150	narration.  However, in order that I may make my meaning quite clear,
150	and that you may no more say, I don't understand,' I will show how the
150	change might be effected.  If Homer had said, 'The priest came, having
150	his daughter's ransom in his hands, supplicating the Achaeans, and
150	above all the kings;' and then if, instead of speaking in the person of
150	Chryses, he had continued in his own person, the words would have been,
150	not imitation, but simple narration.  The passage would have run as
150	follows (I am no poet, and therefore I drop the metre), 'The priest
150	came and prayed the gods on behalf of the Greeks that they might
150	capture Troy and return safely home, but begged that they would give
150	him back his daughter, and take the ransom which he brought, and
150	respect the God.  Thus he spoke, and the other Greeks revered the
150	priest and assented.  But Agamemnon was wroth, and bade him depart and
150	not come again, lest the staff and chaplets of the God should be of no
150	avail to him--the daughter of Chryses should not be released, he
150	said--she should grow old with him in Argos.  And then he told him to
150	go away and not to provoke him, if he intended to get home unscathed.
150	And the old man went away in fear and silence, and, when he had left
150	the camp, he called upon Apollo by his many names, reminding him of
150	everything which he had done pleasing to him, whether in building his
150	temples, or in offering sacrifice, and praying that his good deeds
150	might be returned to him, and that the Achaeans might expiate his tears
150	by the arrows of the god,'--and so on.  In this way the whole becomes
150	simple narrative.
150	
150	I understand, he said.
150	
150	Or you may suppose the opposite case--that the intermediate passages
150	are omitted, and the dialogue only left.
150	
150	That also, he said, I understand; you mean, for example, as in tragedy.
150	
150	You have conceived my meaning perfectly; and if I mistake not, what you
150	failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you, that poetry and
150	mythology are, in some cases, wholly imitative--instances of this are
150	supplied by tragedy and comedy; there is likewise the opposite style,
150	in which the my poet is the only speaker--of this the dithyramb affords
150	the best example; and the combination of both is found in epic, and in
150	several other styles of poetry.  Do I take you with me?
150	
150	Yes, he said; I see now what you meant.
150	
150	I will ask you to remember also what I began by saying, that we had
150	done with the subject and might proceed to the style.
150	
150	Yes, I remember.
150	
150	In saying this, I intended to imply that we must come to an
150	understanding about the mimetic art,--whether the poets, in narrating
150	their stories, are to be allowed by us to imitate, and if so, whether
150	in whole or in part, and if the latter, in what parts; or should all
150	imitation be prohibited?
150	
150	You mean, I suspect, to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be
150	admitted into our State?
150	
150	Yes, I said; but there may be more than this in question: I really do
150	not know as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we go.
150	
150	And go we will, he said.
150	
150	Then, Adeimantus, let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be
150	imitators; or rather, has not this question been decided by the rule
150	already laid down that one man can only do one thing well, and not
150	many; and that if he attempt many, he will altogether fall of gaining
150	much reputation in any?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And this is equally true of imitation; no one man can imitate many
150	things as well as he would imitate a single one?
150	
150	He cannot.
150	
150	Then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in
150	life, and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other
150	parts as well; for even when two species of imitation are nearly
150	allied, the same persons cannot succeed in both, as, for example, the
150	writers of tragedy and comedy--did you not just now call them
150	imitations?
150	
150	Yes, I did; and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot
150	succeed in both.
150	
150	Any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Neither are comic and tragic actors the same; yet all these things are
150	but imitations.
150	
150	They are so.
150	
150	And human nature, Adeimantus, appears to have been coined into yet
150	smaller pieces, and to be as incapable of imitating many things well,
150	as of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies.
150	
150	Quite true, he replied.
150	
150	If then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our
150	guardians, setting aside every other business, are to dedicate
150	themselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the State, making
150	this their craft, and engaging in no work which does not bear on this
150	end, they ought not to practise or imitate anything else; if they
150	imitate at all, they should imitate from youth upward only those
150	characters which are suitable to their profession--the courageous,
150	temperate, holy, free, and the like; but they should not depict or be
150	skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness, lest from
150	imitation they should come to be what they imitate.  Did you never
150	observe how imitations, beginning in early youth and continuing far
150	into life, at length grow into habits and become a second nature,
150	affecting body, voice, and mind?
150	
150	Yes, certainly, he said.
150	
150	Then, I said, we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of
150	whom we say that they ought to be good men, to imitate a woman, whether
150	young or old, quarrelling with her husband, or striving and vaunting
150	against the gods in conceit of her happiness, or when she is in
150	affliction, or sorrow, or weeping; and certainly not one who is in
150	sickness, love, or labour.
150	
150	Very right, he said.
150	
150	Neither must they represent slaves, male or female, performing the
150	offices of slaves?
150	
150	They must not.
150	
150	And surely not bad men, whether cowards or any others, who do the
150	reverse of what we have just been prescribing, who scold or mock or
150	revile one another in drink or out of in drink or, or who in any other
150	manner sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed, as
150	the manner of such is.  Neither should they be trained to imitate the
150	action or speech of men or women who are mad or bad; for madness, like
150	vice, is to be known but not to be practised or imitated.
150	
150	Very true, he replied.
150	
150	Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or
150	boatswains, or the like?
150	
150	How can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds
150	to the callings of any of these?
150	
150	Nor may they imitate the neighing of horses, the bellowing of bulls,
150	the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean, thunder, and all that sort
150	of thing?
150	
150	Nay, he said, if madness be forbidden, neither may they copy the
150	behaviour of madmen.
150	
150	You mean, I said, if I understand you aright, that there is one sort of
150	narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has
150	anything to say, and that another sort will be used by a man of an
150	opposite character and education.
150	
150	And which are these two sorts? he asked.
150	
150	Suppose, I answered, that a just and good man in the course of a
150	narration comes on some saying or action of another good man,--I should
150	imagine that he will like to personate him, and will not be ashamed of
150	this sort of imitation:  he will be most ready to play the part of the
150	good man when he is acting firmly and wisely; in a less degree when he
150	is overtaken by illness or love or drink, or has met with any other
150	disaster.  But when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him,
150	he will not make a study of that; he will disdain such a person, and
150	will assume his likeness, if at all, for a moment only when he is
150	performing some good action; at other times he will be ashamed to play
150	a part which he has never practised, nor will he like to fashion and
150	frame himself after the baser models; he feels the employment of such
150	an art, unless in jest, to be beneath him, and his mind revolts at it.
150	
150	So I should expect, he replied.
150	
150	Then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out
150	of Homer, that is to say, his style will be both imitative and
150	narrative; but there will be very little of the former, and a great
150	deal of the latter.  Do you agree?
150	
150	Certainly, he said; that is the model which such a speaker must
150	necessarily take.
150	
150	But there is another sort of character who will narrate anything, and,
150	the worse lie is, the more unscrupulous he will be; nothing will be too
150	bad for him:  and he will be ready to imitate anything, not as a joke,
150	but in right good earnest, and before a large company.  As I was just
150	now saying, he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder, the noise
150	of wind and hall, or the creaking of wheels, and pulleys, and the
150	various sounds of flutes; pipes, trumpets, and all sorts of
150	instruments:  he will bark like a dog, bleat like a sheep, or crow like
150	a cock; his entire art will consist in imitation of voice and gesture,
150	and there will be very little narration.
150	
150	That, he said, will be his mode of speaking.
150	
150	These, then, are the two kinds of style?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and
150	has but slight changes; and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen
150	for their simplicity, the result is that the speaker, if he speaks
150	correctly, is always pretty much the same in style, and he will keep
150	within the limits of a single harmony (for the changes are not great),
150	and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm?
150	
150	That is quite true, he said.
150	
150	Whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of
150	rhythms, if the music and the style are to correspond, because the
150	style has all sorts of changes.
150	
150	That is also perfectly true, he replied.
150	
150	And do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all
150	poetry, and every form of expression in words?  No one can say anything
150	except in one or other of them or in both together.
150	
150	They include all, he said.
150	
150	And shall we receive into our State all the three styles, or one only
150	of the two unmixed styles? or would you include the mixed?
150	
150	I should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue.
150	
150	Yes, I said, Adeimantus, but the mixed style is also very charming: and
150	indeed the pantomimic, which is the opposite of the one chosen by you,
150	is the most popular style with children and their attendants, and with
150	the world in general.
150	
150	I do not deny it.
150	
150	But I suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our
150	State, in which human nature is not twofold or manifold, for one man
150	plays one part only?
150	
150	Yes; quite unsuitable.
150	
150	And this is the reason why in our State, and in our State only, we
150	shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and a
150	husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier a
150	soldier and not a trader also, and the same throughout?
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	And therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are so
150	clever that they can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a
150	proposal to exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and
150	worship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being; but we must also
150	inform him that in our State such as he are not permitted to exist; the
150	law will not allow them.  And so when we have anointed him with myrrh,
150	and set a garland of wool upon his head, we shall send him away to
150	another city.  For we mean to employ for our souls' health the rougher
150	and severer poet or story-teller, who will imitate the style of the
150	virtuous only, and will follow those models which we prescribed at
150	first when we began the education of our soldiers.
150	
150	We certainly will, he said, if we have the power.
150	
150	Then now, my friend, I said, that part of music or literary education
150	which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished;
150	for the matter and manner have both been discussed.
150	
150	I think so too, he said.
150	
150	Next in order will follow melody and song.
150	
150	That is obvious.
150	
150	Every one can see already what we ought to say about them, if we are to
150	be consistent with ourselves.
150	
150	SOCRATES - GLAUCON
150	
150	I fear, said Glaucon, laughing, that the words 'every one' hardly
150	includes me, for I cannot at the moment say what they should be; though
150	I may guess.
150	
150	At any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts--the words,
150	the melody, and the rhythm; that degree of knowledge I may presuppose?
150	
150	Yes, he said; so much as that you may.
150	
150	And as for the words, there surely be no difference words between words
150	which are and which are not set to music; both will conform to the same
150	laws, and these have been already determined by us?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	We were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had no
150	need of lamentations and strains of sorrow?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow?  You are musical, and
150	can tell me.
150	
150	The harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor Lydian, and the
150	full-toned or bass Lydian, and such like.
150	
150	These then, I said, must be banished; even to women who have a
150	character to maintain they are of no use, and much less to men.
150	Certainly.
150	
150	In the next place, drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly
150	unbecoming the character of our guardians.
150	
150	Utterly unbecoming.
150	
150	And which are the soft or drinking harmonies?
150	
150	The Ionian, he replied, and the Lydian; they are termed 'relaxed.'
150	
150	Well, and are these of any military use?
150	
150	Quite the reverse, he replied; and if so the Dorian and the Phrygian
150	are the only ones which you have left.
150	
150	I answered:  Of the harmonies I know nothing, but I want to have one
150	warlike, to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the
150	hour of danger and stern resolve, or when his cause is failing, and he
150	is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil, and at
150	every such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a
150	determination to endure; and another to be used by him in times of
150	peace and freedom of action, when there is no pressure of necessity,
150	and he is seeking to persuade God by prayer, or man by instruction and
150	admonition, or on the other hand, when he is expressing his willingness
150	to yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition, and which represents
150	him when by prudent conduct he has attained his end, not carried away
150	by his success, but acting moderately and wisely under the
150	circumstances, and acquiescing in the event.  These two harmonies I ask
150	you to leave; the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom, the
150	strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate, the strain
150	of courage, and the strain of temperance; these, I say, leave.
150	
150	And these, he replied, are the Dorian and Phrygian harmonies of which I
150	was just now speaking.
150	
150	Then, I said, if these and these only are to be used in our songs and
150	melodies, we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic
150	scale?
150	
150	I suppose not.
150	
150	Then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners
150	and complex scales, or the makers of any other many-stringed
150	curiously-harmonised instruments?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	But what do you say to flute-makers and flute-players? Would you admit
150	them into our State when you reflect that in this composite use of
150	harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put
150	together; even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute?
150	
150	Clearly not.
150	
150	There remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city, and
150	the shepherds may have a pipe in the country.
150	
150	That is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument.
150	
150	The preferring of Apollo and his instruments to Marsyas and his
150	instruments is not at all strange, I said.
150	
150	Not at all, he replied.
150	
150	And so, by the dog of Egypt, we have been unconsciously purging the
150	State, which not long ago we termed luxurious.
150	
150	And we have done wisely, he replied.
150	
150	Then let us now finish the purgation, I said.  Next in order to
150	harmonies, rhythms will naturally follow, and they should be subject to
150	the same rules, for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre,
150	or metres of every kind, but rather to discover what rhythms are the
150	expressions of a courageous and harmonious life; and when we have found
150	them, we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like
150	spirit, not the words to the foot and melody.  To say what these
150	rhythms are will be your duty--you must teach me them, as you have
150	already taught me the harmonies.
150	
150	But, indeed, he replied, I cannot tell you.  I only know that there are
150	some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are
150	framed, just as in sounds there are four notes out of which all the
150	harmonies are composed; that is an observation which I have made.  But
150	of what sort of lives they are severally the imitations I am unable to
150	say.
150	
150	Then, I said, we must take Damon into our counsels; and he will tell us
150	what rhythms are expressive of meanness, or insolence, or fury, or
150	other unworthiness, and what are to be reserved for the expression of
150	opposite feelings.  And I think that I have an indistinct recollection
150	of his mentioning a complex Cretic rhythm; also a dactylic or heroic,
150	and he arranged them in some manner which I do not quite understand,
150	making the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot, long and
150	short alternating; and, unless I am mistaken, he spoke of an iambic as
150	well as of a trochaic rhythm, and assigned to them short and long
150	quantities.  Also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the
150	movement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm; or perhaps a
150	combination of the two; for I am not certain what he meant.  These
150	matters, however, as I was saying, had better be referred to Damon
150	himself, for the analysis of the subject would be difficult, you know.
150	
150	Rather so, I should say.
150	
150	But there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace
150	is an effect of good or bad rhythm.
150	
150	None at all.
150	
150	And also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and
150	bad style; and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style;
150	for our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the
150	words, and not the words by them.
150	
150	Just so, he said, they should follow the words.
150	
150	And will not the words and the character of the style depend on the
150	temper of the soul?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And everything else on the style?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on
150	simplicity,--I mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered
150	mind and character, not that other simplicity which is only an
150	euphemism for folly?
150	
150	Very true, he replied.
150	
150	And if our youth are to do their work in life, must they not make these
150	graces and harmonies their perpetual aim?
150	
150	They must.
150	
150	And surely the art of the painter and every other creative and
150	constructive art are full of them,--weaving, embroidery, architecture,
150	and every kind of manufacture; also nature, animal and vegetable,--in
150	all of them there is grace or the absence of grace.  And ugliness and
150	discord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill
150	nature, as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and
150	virtue and bear their likeness.
150	
150	That is quite true, he said.
150	
150	But shall our superintendence go no further, and are the poets only to
150	be required by us to express the image of the good in their works, on
150	pain, if they do anything else, of expulsion from our State?  Or is the
150	same control to be extended to other artists, and are they also to be
150	prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance
150	and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other
150	creative arts; and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be
150	prevented from practising his art in our State, lest the taste of our
150	citizens be corrupted by him?  We would not have our guardians grow up
150	amid images of moral deformity, as in some noxious pasture, and there
150	browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day, little
150	by little, until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in
150	their own soul.  Let our artists rather be those who are gifted to
150	discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful; then will our
150	youth dwell in a land of health, amid fair sights and sounds, and
150	receive the good in everything; and beauty, the effluence of fair
150	works, shall flow into the eye and ear, like a health-giving breeze
150	from a purer region, and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years
150	into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason.
150	
150	There can be no nobler training than that, he replied.
150	
150	And therefore, I said, Glaucon, musical training is a more potent
150	instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way
150	into the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten,
150	imparting grace, and making the soul of him who is rightly educated
150	graceful, or of him who is ill-educated ungraceful; and also because he
150	who has received this true education of the inner being will most
150	shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature, and with a
150	true taste, while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his
150	soul the good, and becomes noble and good, he will justly blame and
150	hate the bad, now in the days of his youth, even before he is able to
150	know the reason why; and when reason comes he will recognise and salute
150	the friend with whom his education has made him long familiar.
150	
150	Yes, he said, I quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should
150	be trained in music and on the grounds which you mention.
150	
150	Just as in learning to read, I said, we were satisfied when we knew the
150	letters of the alphabet, which are very few, in all their recurring
150	sizes and combinations; not slighting them as unimportant whether they
150	occupy a space large or small, but everywhere eager to make them out;
150	and not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we
150	recognise them wherever they are found:
150	
150	True--
150	
150	Or, as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water, or in a
150	mirror, only when we know the letters themselves; the same art and
150	study giving us the knowledge of both:
150	
150	Exactly--
150	
150	Even so, as I maintain, neither we nor our guardians, whom we have to
150	educate, can ever become musical until we and they know the essential
150	forms, in all their combinations, and can recognise them and their
150	images wherever they are found, not slighting them either in small
150	things or great, but believing them all to be within the sphere of one
150	art and study.
150	
150	Most assuredly.
150	
150	And when a beautiful soul harmonises with a beautiful form, and the two
150	are cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him who
150	has an eye to see it?
150	
150	The fairest indeed.
150	
150	And the fairest is also the loveliest?
150	
150	That may be assumed.
150	
150	And the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the
150	loveliest; but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul?
150	
150	That is true, he replied, if the deficiency be in his soul; but if
150	there be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it,
150	and will love all the same.
150	
150	I perceive, I said, that you have or have had experiences of this sort,
150	and I agree.  But let me ask you another question: Has excess of
150	pleasure any affinity to temperance?
150	
150	How can that be? he replied; pleasure deprives a man of the use of his
150	faculties quite as much as pain.
150	
150	Or any affinity to virtue in general?
150	
150	None whatever.
150	
150	Any affinity to wantonness and intemperance?
150	
150	Yes, the greatest.
150	
150	And is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love?
150	
150	No, nor a madder.
150	
150	Whereas true love is a love of beauty and order--temperate and
150	harmonious?
150	
150	Quite true, he said.
150	
150	Then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the
150	lover and his beloved; neither of them can have any part in it if their
150	love is of the right sort?
150	
150	No, indeed, Socrates, it must never come near them.
150	
150	Then I suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a
150	law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his
150	love than a father would use to his son, and then only for a noble
150	purpose, and he must first have the other's consent; and this rule is
150	to limit him in all his intercourse, and he is never to be seen going
150	further, or, if he exceeds, he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and
150	bad taste.
150	
150	I quite agree, he said.
150	
150	Thus much of music, which makes a fair ending; for what should be the
150	end of music if not the love of beauty?
150	
150	I agree, he said.
150	
150	After music comes gymnastic, in which our youth are next to be trained.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years; the training in
150	it should be careful and should continue through life.  Now my belief
150	is,--and this is a matter upon which I should like to have your opinion
150	in confirmation of my own, but my own belief is,--not that the good
150	body by any bodily excellence improves the soul, but, on the contrary,
150	that the good soul, by her own excellence, improves the body as far as
150	this may be possible.  What do you say?
150	
150	Yes, I agree.
150	
150	Then, to the mind when adequately trained, we shall be right in handing
150	over the more particular care of the body; and in order to avoid
150	prolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject.
150	
150	Very good.
150	
150	That they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by
150	us; for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and
150	not know where in the world he is.
150	
150	Yes, he said; that a guardian should require another guardian to take
150	care of him is ridiculous indeed.
150	
150	But next, what shall we say of their food; for the men are in training
150	for the great contest of all--are they not?
150	
150	Yes, he said.
150	
150	And will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them?
150	
150	Why not?
150	
150	I am afraid, I said, that a habit of body such as they have is but a
150	sleepy sort of thing, and rather perilous to health.  Do you not
150	observe that these athletes sleep away their lives, and are liable to
150	most dangerous illnesses if they depart, in ever so slight a degree,
150	from their customary regimen?
150	
150	Yes, I do.
150	
150	Then, I said, a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior
150	athletes, who are to be like wakeful dogs, and to see and hear with the
150	utmost keenness; amid the many changes of water and also of food, of
150	summer heat and winter cold, which they will have to endure when on a
150	campaign, they must not be liable to break down in health.
150	
150	That is my view.
150	
150	The really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music
150	which we were just now describing.
150	
150	How so?
150	
150	Why, I conceive that there is a gymnastic which, like our music, is
150	simple and good; and especially the military gymnastic.
150	
150	What do you mean?
150	
150	My meaning may be learned from Homer; he, you know, feeds his heroes at
150	their feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiers' fare; they have
150	no fish, although they are on the shores of the Hellespont, and they
150	are not allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food most
150	convenient for soldiers, requiring only that they should light a fire,
150	and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And I can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere
150	mentioned in Homer.  In proscribing them, however, he is not singular;
150	all professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in
150	good condition should take nothing of the kind.
150	
150	Yes, he said; and knowing this, they are quite right in not taking them.
150	
150	Then you would not approve of Syracusan dinners, and the refinements of
150	Sicilian cookery?
150	
150	I think not.
150	
150	Nor, if a man is to be in condition, would you allow him to have a
150	Corinthian girl as his fair friend?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Neither would you approve of the delicacies, as they are thought, of
150	Athenian confectionery?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	All such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and
150	song composed in the panharmonic style, and in all the rhythms.
150	Exactly.
150	
150	There complexity engendered license, and here disease; whereas
150	simplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul; and
150	simplicity in gymnastic of health in the body.
150	
150	Most true, he said.
150	
150	But when intemperance and disease multiply in a State, halls of justice
150	and medicine are always being opened; and the arts of the doctor and
150	the lawyer give themselves airs, finding how keen is the interest which
150	not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about them.
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	And yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state
150	of education than this, that not only artisans and the meaner sort of
150	people need the skill of first-rate physicians and judges, but also
150	those who would profess to have had a liberal education?  Is it not
150	disgraceful, and a great sign of want of good-breeding, that a man
150	should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of
150	his own at home, and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of
150	other men whom he makes lords and judges over him?
150	
150	Of all things, he said, the most disgraceful.
150	
150	Would you say 'most,' I replied, when you consider that there is a
150	further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a life-long
150	litigant, passing all his days in the courts, either as plaintiff or
150	defendant, but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his
150	litigiousness; he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty; able to
150	take every crooked turn, and wriggle into and out of every hole,
150	bending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice: and all for
150	what?--in order to gain small points not worth mentioning, he not
150	knowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping
150	judge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing.  Is not that still more
150	disgraceful?
150	
150	Yes, he said, that is still more disgraceful.
150	
150	Well, I said, and to require the help of medicine, not when a wound has
150	to be cured, or on occasion of an epidemic, but just because, by
150	indolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing, men fill
150	themselves with waters and winds, as if their bodies were a marsh,
150	compelling the ingenious sons of Asclepius to find more names for
150	diseases, such as flatulence and catarrh; is not this, too, a disgrace?
150	
150	Yes, he said, they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names
150	to diseases.
150	
150	Yes, I said, and I do not believe that there were any such diseases in
150	the days of Asclepius; and this I infer from the circumstance that the
150	hero Eurypylus, after he has been wounded in Homer, drinks a posset of
150	Pramnian wine well besprinkled with barley-meal and grated cheese,
150	which are certainly inflammatory, and yet the sons of Asclepius who
150	were at the Trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink,
150	or rebuke Patroclus, who is treating his case.
150	
150	Well, he said, that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a
150	person in his condition.
150	
150	Not so extraordinary, I replied, if you bear in mind that in former
150	days, as is commonly said, before the time of Herodicus, the guild of
150	Asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine, which may be
150	said to educate diseases.  But Herodicus, being a trainer, and himself
150	of a sickly constitution, by a combination of training and doctoring
150	found out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself, and secondly
150	the rest of the world.
150	
150	How was that? he said.
150	
150	By the invention of lingering death; for he had a mortal disease which
150	he perpetually tended, and as recovery was out of the question, he
150	passed his entire life as a valetudinarian; he could do nothing but
150	attend upon himself, and he was in constant torment whenever he
150	departed in anything from his usual regimen, and so dying hard, by the
150	help of science he struggled on to old age.
150	
150	A rare reward of his skill!
150	
150	Yes, I said; a reward which a man might fairly expect who never
150	understood that, if Asclepius did not instruct his descendants in
150	valetudinarian arts, the omission arose, not from ignorance or
150	inexperience of such a branch of medicine, but because he knew that in
150	all well-ordered states every individual has an occupation to which he
150	must attend, and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being
150	ill.  This we remark in the case of the artisan, but, ludicrously
150	enough, do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort.
150	
150	How do you mean? he said.
150	
150	I mean this:  When a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough
150	and ready cure; an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife,--these
150	are his remedies.  And if some one prescribes for him a course of
150	dietetics, and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head, and
150	all that sort of thing, he replies at once that he has no time to be
150	ill, and that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his
150	disease to the neglect of his customary employment; and therefore
150	bidding good-bye to this sort of physician, he resumes his ordinary
150	habits, and either gets well and lives and does his business, or, if
150	his constitution falls, he dies and has no more trouble.
150	
150	Yes, he said, and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art
150	of medicine thus far only.
150	
150	Has he not, I said, an occupation; and what profit would there be in
150	his life if he were deprived of his occupation?
150	
150	Quite true, he said.
150	
150	But with the rich man this is otherwise; of him we do not say that he
150	has any specially appointed work which he must perform, if he would
150	live.
150	
150	He is generally supposed to have nothing to do.
150	
150	Then you never heard of the saying of Phocylides, that as soon as a man
150	has a livelihood he should practise virtue?
150	
150	Nay, he said, I think that he had better begin somewhat sooner.
150	
150	Let us not have a dispute with him about this, I said; but rather ask
150	ourselves:  Is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man, or
150	can he live without it?  And if obligatory on him, then let us raise a
150	further question, whether this dieting of disorders which is an
150	impediment to the application of the mind t in carpentering and the
150	mechanical arts, does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of
150	Phocylides?
150	
150	Of that, he replied, there can be no doubt; such excessive care of the
150	body, when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic, is most inimical to
150	the practice of virtue.
150	
150	Yes, indeed, I replied, and equally incompatible with the management of
150	a house, an army, or an office of state; and, what is most important of
150	all, irreconcilable with any kind of study or thought or
150	self-reflection--there is a constant suspicion that headache and
150	giddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy, and hence all practising or
150	making trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped; for a
150	man is always fancying that he is being made ill, and is in constant
150	anxiety about the state of his body.
150	
150	Yes, likely enough.
150	
150	And therefore our politic Asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited
150	the power of his art only to persons who, being generally of healthy
150	constitution and habits of life, had a definite ailment; such as these
150	he cured by purges and operations, and bade them live as usual, herein
150	consulting the interests of the State; but bodies which disease had
150	penetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure by
150	gradual processes of evacuation and infusion:  he did not want to
150	lengthen out good-for-nothing lives, or to have weak fathers begetting
150	weaker sons;--if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had
150	no business to cure him; for such a cure would have been of no use
150	either to himself, or to the State.
150	
150	Then, he said, you regard Asclepius as a statesman.
150	
150	Clearly; and his character is further illustrated by his sons.  Note
150	that they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of
150	which I am speaking at the siege of Troy:  You will remember how, when
150	Pandarus wounded Menelaus, they
150	
150	    Sucked the blood out of the wound, and sprinkled soothing remedies,
150	
150	but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or
150	drink in the case of Menelaus, any more than in the case of Eurypylus;
150	the remedies, as they conceived, were enough to heal any man who before
150	he was wounded was healthy and regular in habits; and even though he
150	did happen to drink a posset of Pramnian wine, he might get well all
150	the same.  But they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and
150	intemperate subjects, whose lives were of no use either to themselves
150	or others; the art of medicine was not designed for their good, and
150	though they were as rich as Midas, the sons of Asclepius would have
150	declined to attend them.
150	
150	They were very acute persons, those sons of Asclepius.
150	
150	Naturally so, I replied.  Nevertheless, the tragedians and Pindar
150	disobeying our behests, although they acknowledge that Asclepius was
150	the son of Apollo, say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man
150	who was at the point of death, and for this reason he was struck by
150	lightning.  But we, in accordance with the principle already affirmed
150	by us, will not believe them when they tell us both;--if he was the son
150	of a god, we maintain that he was not avaricious; or, if he was
150	avaricious he was not the son of a god.
150	
150	All that, Socrates, is excellent; but I should like to put a question
150	to you:  Ought there not to be good physicians in a State, and are not
150	the best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions
150	good and bad? and are not the best judges in like manner those who are
150	acquainted with all sorts of moral natures?
150	
150	Yes, I said, I too would have good judges and good physicians.  But do
150	you know whom I think good?
150	
150	Will you tell me?
150	
150	I will, if I can.  Let me however note that in the same question you
150	join two things which are not the same.
150	
150	How so? he asked.
150	
150	Why, I said, you join physicians and judges.  Now the most skilful
150	physicians are those who, from their youth upwards, have combined with
150	the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease; they had
150	better not be robust in health, and should have had all manner of
150	diseases in their own persons.  For the body, as I conceive, is not the
150	instrument with which they cure the body; in that case we could not
150	allow them ever to be or to have been sickly; but they cure the body
150	with the mind, and the mind which has become and is sick can cure
150	nothing.
150	
150	That is very true, he said.
150	
150	But with the judge it is otherwise; since he governs mind by mind; he
150	ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds, and to
150	have associated with them from youth upwards, and to have gone through
150	the whole calendar of crime, only in order that he may quickly infer
150	the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own
150	self-consciousness; the honourable mind which is to form a healthy
150	judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits
150	when young.  And this is the reason why in youth good men often appear
150	to be simple, and are easily practised upon by the dishonest, because
150	they have no examples of what evil is in their own souls.
150	
150	Yes, he said, they are far too apt to be deceived.
150	
150	Therefore, I said, the judge should not be young; he should have
150	learned to know evil, not from his own soul, but from late and long
150	observation of the nature of evil in others: knowledge should be his
150	guide, not personal experience.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that is the ideal of a judge.
150	
150	Yes, I replied, and he will be a good man (which is my answer to your
150	question); for he is good who has a good soul.  But the cunning and
150	suspicious nature of which we spoke,--he who has committed many crimes,
150	and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness, when he is amongst
150	his fellows, is wonderful in the precautions which he takes, because he
150	judges of them by himself:  but when he gets into the company of men of
150	virtue, who have the experience of age, he appears to be a fool again,
150	owing to his unseasonable suspicions; he cannot recognise an honest
150	man, because he has no pattern of honesty in himself; at the same time,
150	as the bad are more numerous than the good, and he meets with them
150	oftener, he thinks himself, and is by others thought to be, rather wise
150	than foolish.
150	
150	Most true, he said.
150	
150	Then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man, but
150	the other; for vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature,
150	educated by time, will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice: the
150	virtuous, and not the vicious, man has wisdom--in my opinion.
150	
150	And in mine also.
150	
150	This is the sort of medicine, and this is the sort of law, which you
150	sanction in your State.  They will minister to better natures, giving
150	health both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in their
150	bodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls they
150	will put an end to themselves.
150	
150	That is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the State.
150	
150	And thus our youth, having been educated only in that simple music
150	which, as we said, inspires temperance, will be reluctant to go to law.
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	And the musician, who, keeping to the same track, is content to
150	practise the simple gymnastic, will have nothing to do with medicine
150	unless in some extreme case.
150	
150	That I quite believe.
150	
150	The very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to
150	stimulate the spirited element of his nature, and not to increase his
150	strength; he will not, like common athletes, use exercise and regimen
150	to develop his muscles.
150	
150	Very right, he said.
150	
150	Neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed, as is
150	often supposed, the one for the training of the soul, the other fir the
150	training of the body.
150	
150	What then is the real object of them?
150	
150	I believe, I said, that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the
150	improvement of the soul.
150	
150	How can that be? he asked.
150	
150	Did you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of
150	exclusive devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive
150	devotion to music?
150	
150	In what way shown? he said.
150	
150	The one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity, the other of
150	softness and effeminacy, I replied.
150	
150	Yes, he said, I am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much
150	of a savage, and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond
150	what is good for him.
150	
150	Yet surely, I said, this ferocity only comes from spirit, which, if
150	rightly educated, would give courage, but, if too much intensified, is
150	liable to become hard and brutal.
150	
150	That I quite think.
150	
150	On the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness.
150	And this also, when too much indulged, will turn to softness, but, if
150	educated rightly, will be gentle and moderate.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?
150	
150	Assuredly.
150	
150	And both should be in harmony?
150	
150	Beyond question.
150	
150	And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And, when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul
150	through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs
150	of which we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed in
150	warbling and the delights of song; in the first stage of the process
150	the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron, and made
150	useful, instead of brittle and useless.  But, if he carries on the
150	softening and soothing process, in the next stage he begins to melt and
150	waste, until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of
150	his soul; and he becomes a feeble warrior.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	If the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is
150	speedily accomplished, but if he have a good deal, then the power of
150	music weakening the spirit renders him excitable;--on the least
150	provocation he flames up at once, and is speedily extinguished; instead
150	of having spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite
150	impracticable.
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	And so in gymnastics, if a man takes violent exercise and is a great
150	feeder, and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy, at
150	first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit,
150	and lie becomes twice the man that he was.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And what happens? if he do nothing else, and holds no con-a verse with
150	the Muses, does not even that intelligence which there may be in him,
150	having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or
150	culture, grow feeble and dull and blind, his mind never waking up or
150	receiving nourishment, and his senses not being purged of their mists?
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	And he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy, uncivilized, never using
150	the weapon of persuasion,--he is like a wild beast, all violence and
150	fierceness, and knows no other way of dealing; and he lives in all
150	ignorance and evil conditions, and has no sense of propriety and grace.
150	
150	That is quite true, he said.
150	
150	And as there are two principles of human nature, one the spirited and
150	the other the philosophical, some God, as I should say, has given
150	mankind two arts answering to them (and only indirectly to the soul and
150	body), in order that these two principles (like the strings of an
150	instrument) may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly
150	harmonised.
150	
150	That appears to be the intention.
150	
150	And he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions, and
150	best attempers them to the soul, may be rightly called the true
150	musician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the
150	strings.
150	
150	You are quite right, Socrates.
150	
150	And such a presiding genius will be always required in our State if the
150	government is to last.
150	
150	Yes, he will be absolutely necessary.
150	
150	Such, then, are our principles of nurture and education: Where would be
150	the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens,
150	or about their hunting and coursing, their gymnastic and equestrian
150	contests?  For these all follow the general principle, and having found
150	that, we shall have no difficulty in discovering them.
150	
150	I dare say that there will be no difficulty.
150	
150	Very good, I said; then what is the next question?  Must we not ask who
150	are to be rulers and who subjects?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	There can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger.
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	And that the best of these must rule.
150	
150	That is also clear.
150	
150	Now, are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to
150	husbandry?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And as we are to have the best of guardians for our city, must they not
150	be those who have most the character of guardians?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And to this end they ought to be wise and efficient, and to have a
150	special care of the State?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves?
150	
150	To be sure.
150	
150	And he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the
150	same interests with himself, and that of which the good or evil fortune
150	is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own?
150	
150	Very true, he replied.
150	
150	Then there must be a selection.  Let us note among the guardians those
150	who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for
150	the good of their country, and the greatest repugnance to do what is
150	against her interests.
150	
150	Those are the right men.
150	
150	And they will have to be watched at every age, in order that we may see
150	whether they preserve their resolution, and never, under the influence
150	either of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty
150	to the State.
150	
150	How cast off? he said.
150	
150	I will explain to you, I replied.  A resolution may go out of a man's
150	mind either with his will or against his will; with his will when he
150	gets rid of a falsehood and learns better, against his will whenever he
150	is deprived of a truth.
150	
150	I understand, he said, the willing loss of a resolution; the meaning of
150	the unwilling I have yet to learn.
150	
150	Why, I said, do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good,
150	and willingly of evil?  Is not to have lost the truth an evil, and to
150	possess the truth a good? and you would agree that to conceive things
150	as they are is to possess the truth?
150	
150	Yes, he replied; I agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived
150	of truth against their will.
150	
150	And is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft, or
150	force, or enchantment?
150	
150	Still, he replied, I do not understand you.
150	
150	I fear that I must have been talking darkly, like the tragedians.  I
150	only mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others
150	forget; argument steals away the hearts of one class, and time of the
150	other; and this I call theft.  Now you understand me?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Those again who are forced are those whom the violence of some pain or
150	grief compels to change their opinion.
150	
150	I understand, he said, and you are quite right.
150	
150	And you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change
150	their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the
150	sterner influence of fear?
150	
150	Yes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to enchant.
150	
150	Therefore, as I was just now saying, we must enquire who are the best
150	guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of
150	the State is to be the rule of their lives.  We must watch them from
150	their youth upwards, and make them perform actions in which they are
150	most likely to forget or to be deceived, and he who remembers and is
150	not deceived is to be selected, and he who falls in the trial is to be
150	rejected.  That will be the way?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for
150	them, in which they will be made to give further proof of the same
150	qualities.
150	
150	Very right, he replied.
150	
150	And then, I said, we must try them with enchantments that is the third
150	sort of test--and see what will be their behaviour: like those who take
150	colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature, so
150	must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind, and again pass them
150	into pleasures, and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in
150	the furnace, that we may discover whether they are armed against all
150	enchantments, and of a noble bearing always, good guardians of
150	themselves and of the music which they have learned, and retaining
150	under all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature, such as
150	will be most serviceable to the individual and to the State.  And he
150	who at every age, as boy and youth and in mature life, has come out of
150	the trial victorious and pure, shall be appointed a ruler and guardian
150	of the State; he shall be honoured in life and death, and shall receive
150	sepulture and other memorials of honour, the greatest that we have to
150	give.  But him who fails, we must reject.  I am inclined to think that
150	this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be
150	chosen and appointed.  I speak generally, and not with any pretension
150	to exactness.
150	
150	And, speaking generally, I agree with you, he said.
150	
150	And perhaps the word 'guardian' in the fullest sense ought to be
150	applied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign
150	enemies and maintain peace among our citizens at home, that the one may
150	not have the will, or the others the power, to harm us.  The young men
150	whom we before called guardians may be more properly designated
150	auxiliaries and supporters of the principles of the rulers.
150	
150	I agree with you, he said.
150	
150	How then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we
150	lately spoke--just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers, if that
150	be possible, and at any rate the rest of the city?
150	
150	What sort of lie? he said.
150	
150	Nothing new, I replied; only an old Phoenician tale of what has often
150	occurred before now in other places, (as the poets say, and have made
150	the world believe,) though not in our time, and I do not know whether
150	such an event could ever happen again, or could now even be made
150	probable, if it did.
150	
150	How your words seem to hesitate on your lips!
150	
150	You will not wonder, I replied, at my hesitation when you have heard.
150	
150	Speak, he said, and fear not.
150	
150	Well then, I will speak, although I really know not how to look you in
150	the face, or in what words to utter the audacious fiction, which I
150	propose to communicate gradually, first to the rulers, then to the
150	soldiers, and lastly to the people.  They are to be told that their
150	youth was a dream, and the education and training which they received
150	from us, an appearance only; in reality during all that time they were
150	being formed and fed in the womb of the earth, where they themselves
150	and their arms and appurtenances were manufactured; when they were
150	completed, the earth, their mother, sent them up; and so, their country
150	being their mother and also their nurse, they are bound to advise for
150	her good, and to defend her against attacks, and her citizens they are
150	to regard as children of the earth and their own brothers.
150	
150	You had good reason, he said, to be ashamed of the lie which you were
150	going to tell.
150	
150	True, I replied, but there is more coming; I have only told you half.
150	Citizens, we shall say to them in our tale, you are brothers, yet God
150	has framed you differently.  Some of you have the power of command, and
150	in the composition of these he has mingled gold, wherefore also they
150	have the greatest honour; others he has made of silver, to be
150	auxillaries; others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has
150	composed of brass and iron; and the species will generally be preserved
150	in the children.  But as all are of the same original stock, a golden
150	parent will sometimes have a silver son, or a silver parent a golden
150	son.  And God proclaims as a first principle to the rulers, and above
150	all else, that there is nothing which should so anxiously guard, or of
150	which they are to be such good guardians, as of the purity of the race.
150	They should observe what elements mingle in their off spring; for if
150	the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and
150	iron, then nature orders a transposition of ranks, and the eye of the
150	ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend
150	in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan, just as there may be
150	sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are
150	raised to honour, and become guardians or auxiliaries.  For an oracle
150	says that when a man of brass or iron guards the State, it will be
150	destroyed.  Such is the tale; is there any possibility of making our
150	citizens believe in it?
150	
150	Not in the present generation, he replied; there is no way of
150	accomplishing this; but their sons may be made to believe in the tale,
150	and their sons' sons, and posterity after them.
150	
150	I see the difficulty, I replied; yet the fostering of such a belief
150	will make them care more for the city and for one another.  Enough,
150	however, of the fiction, which may now fly abroad upon the wings of
150	rumour, while we arm our earth-born heroes, and lead them forth under
150	the command of their rulers.  Let them look round and select a spot
150	whence they can best suppress insurrection, if any prove refractory
150	within, and also defend themselves against enemies, who like wolves may
150	come down on the fold from without; there let them encamp, and when
150	they have encamped, let them sacrifice to the proper Gods and prepare
150	their dwellings.
150	
150	Just so, he said.
150	
150	And their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold
150	of winter and the heat of summer.
150	
150	I suppose that you mean houses, he replied.
150	
150	Yes, I said; but they must be the houses of soldiers, and not of
150	shop-keepers.
150	
150	What is the difference? he said.
150	
150	That I will endeavour to explain, I replied.  To keep watchdogs, who,
150	from want of discipline or hunger, or some evil habit, or evil habit or
150	other, would turn upon the sheep and worry them, and behave not like
150	dogs but wolves, would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd?
150	
150	Truly monstrous, he said.
150	
150	And therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries, being
150	stronger than our citizens, may not grow to be too much for them and
150	become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies?
150	
150	Yes, great care should be taken.
150	
150	And would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?
150	
150	But they are well-educated already, he replied.
150	
150	I cannot be so confident, my dear Glaucon, I said; I am much certain
150	that they ought to be, and that true education, whatever that may be,
150	will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them in their
150	relations to one another, and to those who are under their protection.
150	
150	Very true, he replied.
150	
150	And not only their education, but their habitations, and all that
150	belongs to them, should be such as will neither impair their virtue as
150	guardians, nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens.  Any man of
150	sense must acknowledge that.
150	
150	He must.
150	
150	Then let us consider what will be their way of life, if they are to
150	realize our idea of them.  In the first place, none of them should have
150	any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary; neither
150	should they have a private house or store closed against any one who
150	has a mind to enter; their provisions should be only such as are
150	required by trained warriors, who are men of temperance and courage;
150	they should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay,
150	enough to meet the expenses of the year and no more; and they will go
150	and live together like soldiers in a camp.  Gold and silver we will
150	tell them that they have from God; the diviner metal is within them,
150	and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current among
150	men, and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly admixture;
150	for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy deeds, but
150	their own is undefiled.  And they alone of all the citizens may not
150	touch or handle silver or gold, or be under the same roof with them, or
150	wear them, or drink from them.  And this will be their salvation, and
150	they will be the saviours of the State.  But should they ever acquire
150	homes or lands or moneys of their own, they will become housekeepers
150	and husbandmen instead of guardians, enemies and tyrants instead of
150	allies of the other citizens; hating and being hated, plotting and
150	being plotted against, they will pass their whole life in much greater
150	terror of internal than of external enemies, and the hour of ruin, both
150	to themselves and to the rest of the State, will be at hand.  For all
150	which reasons may we not say that thus shall our State be ordered, and
150	that these shall be the regulations appointed by us for guardians
150	concerning their houses and all other matters?  other
150	
150	Yes, said Glaucon.
150	
150	
150	
150	
150	BOOK IV
150	
150	
150	ADEIMANTUS - SOCRATES
150	
150	HERE Adeimantus interposed a question:  How would you answer, Socrates,
150	said he, if a person were to say that you are making these people
150	miserable, and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness; the
150	city in fact belongs to them, but they are none the better for it;
150	whereas other men acquire lands, and build large and handsome houses,
150	and have everything handsome about them, offering sacrifices to the
150	gods on their own account, and practising hospitality; moreover, as you
150	were saying just now, they have gold and silver, and all that is usual
150	among the favourites of fortune; but our poor citizens are no better
150	than mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting
150	guard?
150	
150	Yes, I said; and you may add that they are only fed, and not paid in
150	addition to their food, like other men; and therefore they cannot, if
150	they would, take a journey of pleasure; they have no money to spend on
150	a mistress or any other luxurious fancy, which, as the world goes, is
150	thought to be happiness; and many other accusations of the same nature
150	might be added.
150	
150	But, said he, let us suppose all this to be included in the charge.
150	
150	You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	If we proceed along the old path, my belief, I said, is that we shall
150	find the answer.  And our answer will be that, even as they are, our
150	guardians may very likely be the happiest of men; but that our aim in
150	founding the State was not the disproportionate happiness of any one
150	class, but the greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a
150	State which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should
150	be most likely to find Justice, and in the ill-ordered State injustice:
150	and, having found them, we might then decide which of the two is the
150	happier.  At present, I take it, we are fashioning the happy State, not
150	piecemeal, or with a view of making a few happy citizens, but as a
150	whole; and by-and-by we will proceed to view the opposite kind of
150	State.  Suppose that we were painting a statue, and some one came up to
150	us and said, Why do you not put the most beautiful colours on the most
150	beautiful parts of the body--the eyes ought to be purple, but you have
150	made them black--to him we might fairly answer, Sir, you would not
150	surely have us beautify the eyes to such a degree that they are no
150	longer eyes; consider rather whether, by giving this and the other
150	features their due proportion, we make the whole beautiful.  And so I
150	say to you, do not compel us to assign to the guardians a sort of
150	happiness which will make them anything but guardians; for we too can
150	clothe our husbandmen in royal apparel, and set crowns of gold on their
150	heads, and bid them till the ground as much as they like, and no more.
150	Our potters also might be allowed to repose on couches, and feast by
150	the fireside, passing round the winecup, while their wheel is
150	conveniently at hand, and working at pottery only as much as they like;
150	in this way we might make every class happy-and then, as you imagine,
150	the whole State would be happy.  But do not put this idea into our
150	heads; for, if we listen to you, the husbandman will be no longer a
150	husbandman, the potter will cease to be a potter, and no one will have
150	the character of any distinct class in the State.  Now this is not of
150	much consequence where the corruption of society, and pretension to be
150	what you are not, is confined to cobblers; but when the guardians of
150	the laws and of the government are only seemingly and not real
150	guardians, then see how they turn the State upside down; and on the
150	other hand they alone have the power of giving order and happiness to
150	the State.  We mean our guardians to be true saviours and not the
150	destroyers of the State, whereas our opponent is thinking of peasants
150	at a festival, who are enjoying a life of revelry, not of citizens who
150	are doing their duty to the State.  But, if so, we mean different
150	things, and he is speaking of something which is not a State.  And
150	therefore we must consider whether in appointing our guardians we would
150	look to their greatest happiness individually, or whether this
150	principle of happiness does not rather reside in the State as a whole.
150	But the latter be the truth, then the guardians and auxillaries, and
150	all others equally with them, must be compelled or induced to do their
150	own work in the best way.  And thus the whole State will grow up in a
150	noble order, and the several classes will receive the proportion of
150	happiness which nature assigns to them.
150	
150	I think that you are quite right.
150	
150	I wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to me.
150	
150	What may that be?
150	
150	There seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts.
150	
150	What are they?
150	
150	Wealth, I said, and poverty.
150	
150	How do they act?
150	
150	The process is as follows:  When a potter becomes rich, will he, think
150	you, any longer take the same pains with his art?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	He will grow more and more indolent and careless?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And the result will be that he becomes a worse potter?
150	
150	Yes; he greatly deteriorates.
150	
150	But, on the other hand, if he has no money, and cannot provide himself
150	tools or instruments, he will not work equally well himself, nor will
150	he teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well.
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Then, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen and
150	their work are equally liable to degenerate?
150	
150	That is evident.
150	
150	Here, then, is a discovery of new evils, I said, against which the
150	guardians will have to watch, or they will creep into the city
150	unobserved.
150	
150	What evils?
150	
150	Wealth, I said, and poverty; the one is the parent of luxury and
150	indolence, and the other of meanness and viciousness, and both of
150	discontent.
150	
150	That is very true, he replied; but still I should like to know,
150	Socrates, how our city will be able to go to war, especially against an
150	enemy who is rich and powerful, if deprived of the sinews of war.
150	
150	There would certainly be a difficulty, I replied, in going to war with
150	one such enemy; but there is no difficulty where there are two of them.
150	
150	How so? he asked.
150	
150	In the first place, I said, if we have to fight, our side will be
150	trained warriors fighting against an army of rich men.
150	
150	That is true, he said.
150	
150	And do you not suppose, Adeimantus, that a single boxer who was perfect
150	in his art would easily be a match for two stout and well-to-do
150	gentlemen who were not boxers?
150	
150	Hardly, if they came upon him at once.
150	
150	What, not, I said, if he were able to run away and then turn and strike
150	at the one who first came up?  And supposing he were to do this several
150	times under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an expert,
150	overturn more than one stout personage?
150	
150	Certainly, he said, there would be nothing wonderful in that.
150	
150	And yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science and
150	practice of boxing than they have in military qualities.
150	
150	Likely enough.
150	
150	Then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or
150	three times their own number?
150	
150	I agree with you, for I think you right.
150	
150	And suppose that, before engaging, our citizens send an embassy to one
150	of the two cities, telling them what is the truth: Silver and gold we
150	neither have nor are permitted to have, but you may; do you therefore
150	come and help us in war, of and take the spoils of the other city:
150	Who, on hearing these words, would choose to fight against lean wiry
150	dogs, rather than, with the dogs on their side, against fat and tender
150	sheep?
150	
150	That is not likely; and yet there might be a danger to the poor State
150	if the wealth of many States were to be gathered into one.
150	
150	But how simple of you to use the term State at all of any but our own!
150	
150	Why so?
150	
150	You ought to speak of other States in the plural number; not one of
150	them is a city, but many cities, as they say in the game.  For indeed
150	any city, however small, is in fact divided into two, one the city of
150	the poor, the other of the rich; these are at war with one another; and
150	in either there are many smaller divisions, and you would be altogether
150	beside the mark if you treated them all as a single State.  But if you
150	deal with them as many, and give the wealth or power or persons of the
150	one to the others, you will always have a great many friends and not
150	many enemies.  And your State, while the wise order which has now been
150	prescribed continues to prevail in her, will be the greatest of States,
150	I do not mean to say in reputation or appearance, but in deed and
150	truth, though she number not more than a thousand defenders.  A single
150	State which is her equal you will hardly find, either among Hellenes or
150	barbarians, though many that appear to be as great and many times
150	greater.
150	
150	That is most true, he said.
150	
150	And what, I said, will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when
150	they are considering the size of the State and the amount of territory
150	which they are to include, and beyond which they will not go?
150	
150	What limit would you propose?
150	
150	I would allow the State to increase so far as is consistent with unity;
150	that, I think, is the proper limit.
150	
150	Very good, he said.
150	
150	Here then, I said, is another order which will have to be conveyed to
150	our guardians:  Let our city be accounted neither large nor small, but
150	one and self-sufficing.
150	
150	And surely, said he, this is not a very severe order which we impose
150	upon them.
150	
150	And the other, said I, of which we were speaking before is lighter
150	still, I mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians
150	when inferior, and of elevating into the rank of guardians the
150	offspring of the lower classes, when naturally superior.  The intention
150	was, that, in the case of the citizens generally, each individual
150	should be put to the use for which nature which nature intended him,
150	one to one work, and then every man would do his own business, and be
150	one and not many; and so the whole city would be one and not many.
150	
150	Yes, he said; that is not so difficult.
150	
150	The regulations which we are prescribing, my good Adeimantus, are not,
150	as might be supposed, a number of great principles, but trifles all, if
150	care be taken, as the saying is, of the one great thing,--a thing,
150	however, which I would rather call, not great, but sufficient for our
150	purpose.
150	
150	What may that be? he asked.
150	
150	Education, I said, and nurture:  If our citizens are well educated, and
150	grow into sensible men, they will easily see their way through all
150	these, as well as other matters which I omit; such, for example, as
150	marriage, the possession of women and the procreation of children,
150	which will all follow the general principle that friends have all
150	things in common, as the proverb says.
150	
150	That will be the best way of settling them.
150	
150	Also, I said, the State, if once started well, moves with accumulating
150	force like a wheel.  For good nurture and education implant good
150	constitutions, and these good constitutions taking root in a good
150	education improve more and more, and this improvement affects the breed
150	in man as in other animals.
150	
150	Very possibly, he said.
150	
150	Then to sum up:  This is the point to which, above all, the attention
150	of our rulers should be directed,--that music and gymnastic be
150	preserved in their original form, and no innovation made.  They must do
150	their utmost to maintain them intact.  And when any one says that
150	mankind most regard
150	
150	    The newest song which the singers have,
150	
150	they will be afraid that he may be praising, not new songs, but a new
150	kind of song; and this ought not to be praised, or conceived to be the
150	meaning of the poet; for any musical innovation is full of danger to
150	the whole State, and ought to be prohibited.  So Damon tells me, and I
150	can quite believe him;-he says that when modes of music change, of the
150	State always change with them.
150	
150	Yes, said Adeimantus; and you may add my suffrage to Damon's and your
150	own.
150	
150	Then, I said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress
150	in music?
150	
150	Yes, he said; the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in.
150	
150	Yes, I replied, in the form of amusement; and at first sight it appears
150	harmless.
150	
150	Why, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little by
150	little this spirit of licence, finding a home, imperceptibly penetrates
150	into manners and customs; whence, issuing with greater force, it
150	invades contracts between man and man, and from contracts goes on to
150	laws and constitutions, in utter recklessness, ending at last,
150	Socrates, by an overthrow of all rights, private as well as public.
150	
150	Is that true?  I said.
150	
150	That is my belief, he replied.
150	
150	Then, as I was saying, our youth should be trained from the first in a
150	stricter system, for if amusements become lawless, and the youths
150	themselves become lawless, they can never grow up into well-conducted
150	and virtuous citizens.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	And when they have made a good beginning in play, and by the help of
150	music have gained the habit of good order, then this habit of order, in
150	a manner how unlike the lawless play of the others! will accompany them
150	in all their actions and be a principle of growth to them, and if there
150	be any fallen places a principle in the State will raise them up again.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	Thus educated, they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which
150	their predecessors have altogether neglected.
150	
150	What do you mean?
150	
150	I mean such things as these:--when the young are to be silent before
150	their elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and
150	making them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes
150	are to be worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners
150	in general.  You would agree with me?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	But there is, I think, small wisdom in legislating about such
150	matters,--I doubt if it is ever done; nor are any precise written
150	enactments about them likely to be lasting.
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	It would seem, Adeimantus, that the direction in which education starts
150	a man, will determine his future life.  Does not like always attract
150	like?
150	
150	To be sure.
150	
150	Until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good, and
150	may be the reverse of good?
150	
150	That is not to be denied.
150	
150	And for this reason, I said, I shall not attempt to legislate further
150	about them.
150	
150	Naturally enough, he replied.
150	
150	Well, and about the business of the agora, dealings and the ordinary
150	dealings between man and man, or again about agreements with the
150	commencement with artisans; about insult and injury, of the
150	commencement of actions, and the appointment of juries, what would you
150	say? there may also arise questions about any impositions and
150	extractions of market and harbour dues which may be required, and in
150	general about the regulations of markets, police, harbours, and the
150	like.  But, oh heavens! shall we condescend to legislate on any of
150	these particulars?
150	
150	I think, he said, that there is no need to impose laws about them on
150	good men; what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough
150	for themselves.
150	
150	Yes, I said, my friend, if God will only preserve to them the laws
150	which we have given them.
150	
150	And without divine help, said Adeimantus, they will go on for ever
150	making and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining
150	perfection.
150	
150	You would compare them, I said, to those invalids who, having no
150	self-restraint, will not leave off their habits of intemperance?
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	Yes, I said; and what a delightful life they lead! they are always
150	doctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders, and always
150	fancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises
150	them to try.
150	
150	Such cases are very common, he said, with invalids of this sort.
150	
150	Yes, I replied; and the charming thing is that they deem him their
150	worst enemy who tells them the truth, which is simply that, unless they
150	give up eating and drinking and wenching and idling, neither drug nor
150	cautery nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail.
150	
150	Charming! he replied.  I see nothing charming in going into a passion
150	with a man who tells you what is right.
150	
150	These gentlemen, I said, do not seem to be in your good graces.
150	
150	Assuredly not.
150	
150	Nor would you praise the behaviour of States which act like the men
150	whom I was just now describing.  For are there not ill-ordered States
150	in which the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the
150	constitution; and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under
150	this regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in
150	anticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and
150	good statesman--do not these States resemble the persons whom I was
150	describing?
150	
150	Yes, he said; the States are as bad as the men; and I am very far from
150	praising them.
150	
150	But do you not admire, I said, the coolness and dexterity of these
150	ready ministers of political corruption?
150	
150	Yes, he said, I do; but not of all of them, for there are some whom the
150	applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are
150	really statesmen, and these are not much to be admired.
150	
150	What do you mean?  I said; you should have more feeling for them.  When
150	a man cannot measure, and a great many others who cannot measure
150	declare that he is four cubits high, can he help believing what they
150	say?
150	
150	Nay, he said, certainly not in that case.
150	
150	Well, then, do not be angry with them; for are they not as good as a
150	play, trying their hand at paltry reforms such as I was describing;
150	they are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of
150	frauds in contracts, and the other rascalities which I was mentioning,
150	not knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra?
150	
150	Yes, he said; that is just what they are doing.
150	
150	I conceive, I said, that the true legislator will not trouble himself
150	with this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the
150	constitution either in an ill-ordered or in a well-ordered State; for
150	in the former they are quite useless, and in the latter there will be
150	no difficulty in devising them; and many of them will naturally flow
150	out of our previous regulations.
150	
150	What, then, he said, is still remaining to us of the work of
150	legislation?
150	
150	Nothing to us, I replied; but to Apollo, the God of Delphi, there
150	remains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of
150	all.
150	
150	Which are they? he said.
150	
150	The institution of temples and sacrifices, and the entire service of
150	gods, demigods, and heroes; also the ordering of the repositories of
150	the dead, and the rites which have to be observed by him who would
150	propitiate the inhabitants of the world below.  These are matters of
150	which we are ignorant ourselves, and as founders of a city we should be
150	unwise in trusting them to any interpreter but our ancestral deity.  He
150	is the god who sits in the center, on the navel of the earth, and he is
150	the interpreter of religion to all mankind.
150	
150	You are right, and we will do as you propose.
150	
150	But where, amid all this, is justice? son of Ariston, tell me where.
150	Now that our city has been made habitable, light a candle and search,
150	and get your brother and Polemarchus and the rest of our friends to
150	help, and let us see where in it we can discover justice and where
150	injustice, and in what they differ from one another, and which of them
150	the man who would be happy should have for his portion, whether seen or
150	unseen by gods and men.
150	
150	SOCRATES - GLAUCON
150	
150	Nonsense, said Glaucon:  did you not promise to search yourself, saying
150	that for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety?
150	
150	I do not deny that I said so, and as you remind me, I will be as good
150	as my word; but you must join.
150	
150	We will, he replied.
150	
150	Well, then, I hope to make the discovery in this way:  I mean to begin
150	with the assumption that our State, if rightly ordered, is perfect.
150	
150	That is most certain.
150	
150	And being perfect, is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and just.
150	
150	That is likewise clear.
150	
150	And whichever of these qualities we find in the State, the one which is
150	not found will be the residue?
150	
150	Very good.
150	
150	If there were four things, and we were searching for one of them,
150	wherever it might be, the one sought for might be known to us from the
150	first, and there would be no further trouble; or we might know the
150	other three first, and then the fourth would clearly be the one left.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	And is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues, which are
150	also four in number?
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	First among the virtues found in the State, wisdom comes into view, and
150	in this I detect a certain peculiarity.
150	
150	What is that?
150	
150	The State which we have been describing is said to be wise as being
150	good in counsel?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance,
150	but by knowledge, do men counsel well?
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	And the kinds of knowledge in a State are many and diverse?
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	There is the knowledge of the carpenter; but is that the sort of
150	knowledge which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel?
150	
150	Certainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill in
150	carpentering.
150	
150	Then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge
150	which counsels for the best about wooden implements?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I said,
150	nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?
150	
150	Not by reason of any of them, he said.
150	
150	Nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth; that would
150	give the city the name of agricultural?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Well, I said, and is there any knowledge in our recently founded State
150	among any of the citizens which advises, not about any particular thing
150	in the State, but about the whole, and considers how a State can best
150	deal with itself and with other States?
150	
150	There certainly is.
150	
150	And what is knowledge, and among whom is it found?  I asked.
150	
150	It is the knowledge of the guardians, he replied, and found among those
150	whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians.
150	
150	And what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this
150	sort of knowledge?
150	
150	The name of good in counsel and truly wise.
150	
150	And will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more
150	smiths?
150	
150	The smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous.
150	
150	Will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a
150	name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?
150	
150	Much the smallest.
150	
150	And so by reason of the smallest part or class, and of the knowledge
150	which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself, the whole
150	State, being thus constituted according to nature, will be wise; and
150	this, which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom, has been
150	ordained by nature to be of all classes the least.
150	
150	Most true.
150	
150	Thus, then, I said, the nature and place in the State of one of the
150	four virtues has somehow or other been discovered.
150	
150	And, in my humble opinion, very satisfactorily discovered, he replied.
150	
150	Again, I said, there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage;
150	and in what part that quality resides which gives the name of
150	courageous to the State.
150	
150	How do you mean?
150	
150	Why, I said, every one who calls any State courageous or cowardly, will
150	be thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the State's
150	behalf.
150	
150	No one, he replied, would ever think of any other.
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	The rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly but their
150	courage or cowardice will not, as I conceive, have the effect of making
150	the city either the one or the other.
150	
150	The city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which
150	preserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of
150	things to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator
150	educated them; and this is what you term courage.
150	
150	I should like to hear what you are saying once more, for I do not think
150	that I perfectly understand you.
150	
150	I mean that courage is a kind of salvation.
150	
150	Salvation of what?
150	
150	Of the opinion respecting things to be feared, what they are and of
150	what nature, which the law implants through education; and I mean by
150	the words 'under all circumstances' to intimate that in pleasure or in
150	pain, or under the influence of desire or fear, a man preserves, and
150	does not lose this opinion.  Shall I give you an illustration?
150	
150	If you please.
150	
150	You know, I said, that dyers, when they want to dye wool for making the
150	true sea-purple, begin by selecting their white colour first; this they
150	prepare and dress with much care and pains, in order that the white
150	ground may take the purple hue in full perfection.  The dyeing then
150	proceeds; and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour,
150	and no washing either with lyes or without them can take away the
150	bloom.  But, when the ground has not been duly prepared, you will have
150	noticed how poor is the look either of purple or of any other colour.
150	
150	Yes, he said; I know that they have a washed-out and ridiculous
150	appearance.
150	
150	Then now, I said, you will understand what our object was in selecting
150	our soldiers, and educating them in music and gymnastic; we were
150	contriving influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the
150	laws in perfection, and the colour of their opinion about dangers and
150	of every other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and
150	training, not to be washed away by such potent lyes as
150	pleasure--mightier agent far in washing the soul than any soda or lye;
150	or by sorrow, fear, and desire, the mightiest of all other solvents.
150	And this sort of universal saving power of true opinion in conformity
150	with law about real and false dangers I call and maintain to be
150	courage, unless you disagree.
150	
150	But I agree, he replied; for I suppose that you mean to exclude mere
150	uninstructed courage, such as that of a wild beast or of a slave--this,
150	in your opinion, is not the courage which the law ordains, and ought to
150	have another name.
150	
150	Most certainly.
150	
150	Then I may infer courage to be such as you describe?
150	
150	Why, yes, said I, you may, and if you add the words 'of a citizen,' you
150	will not be far wrong;--hereafter, if you like, we will carry the
150	examination further, but at present we are we w seeking not for courage
150	but justice; and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough.
150	
150	You are right, he replied.
150	
150	Two virtues remain to be discovered in the State-first temperance, and
150	then justice which is the end of our search.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Now, can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance?
150	
150	I do not know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do I desire
150	that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of;
150	and therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering
150	temperance first.
150	
150	Certainly, I replied, I should not be justified in refusing your
150	request.
150	
150	Then consider, he said.
150	
150	Yes, I replied; I will; and as far as I can at present see, the virtue
150	of temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the
150	preceding.
150	
150	How so? he asked.
150	
150	Temperance, I replied, is the ordering or controlling of certain
150	pleasures and desires; this is curiously enough implied in the saying
150	of 'a man being his own master' and other traces of the same notion may
150	be found in language.
150	
150	No doubt, he said.
150	
150	There is something ridiculous in the expression 'master of himself';
150	for the master is also the servant and the servant the master; and in
150	all these modes of speaking the same person is denoted.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	The meaning is, I believe, that in the human soul there is a better and
150	also a worse principle; and when the better has the worse under
150	control, then a man is said to be master of himself; and this is a term
150	of praise:  but when, owing to evil education or association, the
150	better principle, which is also the smaller, is overwhelmed by the
150	greater mass of the worse--in this case he is blamed and is called the
150	slave of self and unprincipled.
150	
150	Yes, there is reason in that.
150	
150	And now, I said, look at our newly created State, and there you will
150	find one of these two conditions realised; for the State, as you will
150	acknowledge, may be justly called master of itself, if the words
150	'temperance' and 'self-mastery' truly express the rule of the better
150	part over the worse.
150	
150	Yes, he said, I see that what you say is true.
150	
150	Let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires
150	and pains are generally found in children and women and servants, and
150	in the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class.
150	
150	Certainly, he said.
150	
150	Whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason, and are
150	under the guidance of mind and true opinion, are to be found only in a
150	few, and those the best born and best educated.
150	
150	Very true.  These two, as you may perceive, have a place in our State;
150	and the meaner desires of the are held down by the virtuous desires and
150	wisdom of the few.
150	
150	That I perceive, he said.
150	
150	Then if there be any city which may be described as master of its own
150	pleasures and desires, and master of itself, ours may claim such a
150	designation?
150	
150	Certainly, he replied.
150	
150	It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And if there be any State in which rulers and subjects will be agreed
150	as to the question who are to rule, that again will be our State?
150	
150	Undoubtedly.
150	
150	And the citizens being thus agreed among themselves, in which class
150	will temperance be found--in the rulers or in the subjects?
150	
150	In both, as I should imagine, he replied.
150	
150	Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance
150	was a sort of harmony?
150	
150	Why so?
150	
150	Why, because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom, each of which
150	resides in a part only, the one making the State wise and the other
150	valiant; not so temperance, which extends to the whole, and runs
150	through all the notes of the scale, and produces a harmony of the
150	weaker and the stronger and the middle class, whether you suppose them
150	to be stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth, or
150	anything else.  Most truly then may we deem temperance to be the
150	agreement of the naturally superior and inferior, as to the right to
150	rule of either, both in states and individuals.
150	
150	I entirely agree with you.
150	
150	And so, I said, we may consider three out of the four virtues to have
150	been discovered in our State.  The last of those qualities which make a
150	state virtuous must be justice, if we only knew what that was.
150	
150	The inference is obvious.
150	
150	The time then has arrived, Glaucon, when, like huntsmen, we should
150	surround the cover, and look sharp that justice does not steal away,
150	and pass out of sight and escape us; for beyond a doubt she is
150	somewhere in this country:  watch therefore and strive to catch a sight
150	of her, and if you see her first, let me know.
150	
150	Would that I could! but you should regard me rather as a follower who
150	has just eyes enough to, see what you show him--that is about as much
150	as I am good for.
150	
150	Offer up a prayer with me and follow.
150	
150	I will, but you must show me the way.
150	
150	Here is no path, I said, and the wood is dark and perplexing; still we
150	must push on.
150	
150	Let us push on.
150	
150	Here I saw something:  Halloo!  I said, I begin to perceive a track,
150	and I believe that the quarry will not escape.
150	
150	Good news, he said.
150	
150	Truly, I said, we are stupid fellows.
150	
150	Why so?
150	
150	Why, my good sir, at the beginning of our enquiry, ages ago, there was
150	justice tumbling out at our feet, and we never saw her; nothing could
150	be more ridiculous.  Like people who go about looking for what they
150	have in their hands--that was the way with us--we looked not at what we
150	were seeking, but at what was far off in the distance; and therefore, I
150	suppose, we missed her.
150	
150	What do you mean?
150	
150	I mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking
150	of justice, and have failed to recognise her.
150	
150	I grow impatient at the length of your exordium.
150	
150	Well then, tell me, I said, whether I am right or not: You remember the
150	original principle which we were always laying down at the foundation
150	of the State, that one man should practise one thing only, the thing to
150	which his nature was best adapted;--now justice is this principle or a
150	part of it.
150	
150	Yes, we often said that one man should do one thing only.
150	
150	Further, we affirmed that justice was doing one's own business, and not
150	being a busybody; we said so again and again, and many others have said
150	the same to us.
150	
150	Yes, we said so.
150	
150	Then to do one's own business in a certain way may be assumed to be
150	justice.  Can you tell me whence I derive this inference?
150	
150	I cannot, but I should like to be told.
150	
150	Because I think that this is the only virtue which remains in the State
150	when the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are
150	abstracted; and, that this is the ultimate cause and condition of the
150	existence of all of them, and while remaining in them is also their
150	preservative; and we were saying that if the three were discovered by
150	us, justice would be the fourth or remaining one.
150	
150	That follows of necessity.
150	
150	If we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its
150	presence contributes most to the excellence of the State, whether the
150	agreement of rulers and subjects, or the preservation in the soldiers
150	of the opinion which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers,
150	or wisdom and watchfulness in the rulers, or whether this other which I
150	am mentioning, and which is found in children and women, slave and
150	freeman, artisan, ruler, subject,--the quality, I mean, of every one
150	doing his own work, and not being a busybody, would claim the palm--the
150	question is not so easily answered.
150	
150	Certainly, he replied, there would be a difficulty in saying which.
150	
150	Then the power of each individual in the State to do his own work
150	appears to compete with the other political virtues, wisdom,
150	temperance, courage.
150	
150	Yes, he said.
150	
150	And the virtue which enters into this competition is justice?
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	Let us look at the question from another point of view: Are not the
150	rulers in a State those to whom you would entrust the office of
150	determining suits at law?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither
150	take what is another's, nor be deprived of what is his own?
150	
150	Yes; that is their principle.
150	
150	Which is a just principle?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Then on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and
150	doing what is a man's own, and belongs to him?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Think, now, and say whether you agree with me or not.  Suppose a
150	carpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler, or a cobbler of a
150	carpenter; and suppose them to exchange their implements or their
150	duties, or the same person to be doing the work of both, or whatever be
150	the change; do you think that any great harm would result to the State?
150	
150	Not much.
150	
150	But when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a
150	trader, having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number
150	of his followers, or any like advantage, attempts to force his way into
150	the class of warriors, or a warrior into that of legislators and
150	guardians, for which he is unfitted, and either to take the implements
150	or the duties of the other; or when one man is trader, legislator, and
150	warrior all in one, then I think you will agree with me in saying that
150	this interchange and this meddling of one with another is the ruin of
150	the State.
150	
150	Most true.
150	
150	Seeing then, I said, that there are three distinct classes, any
150	meddling of one with another, or the change of one into another, is the
150	greatest harm to the State, and may be most justly termed evil-doing?
150	
150	Precisely.
150	
150	And the greatest degree of evil-doing to one's own city would be termed
150	by you injustice?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	This then is injustice; and on the other hand when the trader, the
150	auxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business, that is
150	justice, and will make the city just.
150	
150	I agree with you.
150	
150	We will not, I said, be over-positive as yet; but if, on trial, this
150	conception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in the
150	State, there will be no longer any room for doubt; if it be not
150	verified, we must have a fresh enquiry.  First let us complete the old
150	investigation, which we began, as you remember, under the impression
150	that, if we could previously examine justice on the larger scale, there
150	would be less difficulty in discerning her in the individual.  That
150	larger example appeared to be the State, and accordingly we constructed
150	as good a one as we could, knowing well that in the good State justice
150	would be found.  Let the discovery which we made be now applied to the
150	individual--if they agree, we shall be satisfied; or, if there be a
150	difference in the individual, we will come back to the State and have
150	another trial of the theory.  The friction of the two when rubbed
150	together may possibly strike a light in which justice will shine forth,
150	and the vision which is then revealed we will fix in our souls.
150	
150	That will be in regular course; let us do as you say.
150	
150	I proceeded to ask:  When two things, a greater and less, are called by
150	the same name, are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the
150	same?
150	
150	Like, he replied.
150	
150	The just man then, if we regard the idea of justice only, will be like
150	the just State?
150	
150	He will.
150	
150	And a State was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the
150	State severally did their own business; and also thought to be
150	temperate and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections
150	and qualities of these same classes?
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	And so of the individual; we may assume that he has the same three
150	principles in his own soul which are found in the State; and he may be
150	rightly described in the same terms, because he is affected in the same
150	manner?
150	
150	Certainly, he said.
150	
150	Once more then, O my friend, we have alighted upon an easy
150	question--whether the soul has these three principles or not?
150	
150	An easy question!  Nay, rather, Socrates, the proverb holds that hard
150	is the good.
150	
150	Very true, I said; and I do not think that the method which we are
150	employing is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question;
150	the true method is another and a longer one.  Still we may arrive at a
150	solution not below the level of the previous enquiry.
150	
150	May we not be satisfied with that? he said;--under the circumstances, I
150	am quite content.
150	
150	I too, I replied, shall be extremely well satisfied.
150	
150	Then faint not in pursuing the speculation, he said.
150	
150	Must we not acknowledge, I said, that in each of us there are the same
150	principles and habits which there are in the State; and that from the
150	individual they pass into the State?--how else can they come there?
150	Take the quality of passion or spirit;--it would be ridiculous to
150	imagine that this quality, when found in States, is not derived from
150	the individuals who are supposed to possess it, e.g. the Thracians,
150	Scythians, and in general the northern nations; and the same may be
150	said of the love of knowledge, which is the special characteristic of
150	our part of the world, or of the love of money, which may, with equal
150	truth, be attributed to the Phoenicians and Egyptians.
150	
150	Exactly so, he said.
150	
150	There is no difficulty in understanding this.
150	
150	None whatever.
150	
150	But the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether
150	these principles are three or one; whether, that is to say, we learn
150	with one part of our nature, are angry with another, and with a third
150	part desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites; or whether the
150	whole soul comes into play in each sort of action--to determine that is
150	the difficulty.
150	
150	Yes, he said; there lies the difficulty.
150	
150	Then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or
150	different.
150	
150	How can we? he asked.
150	
150	I replied as follows:  The same thing clearly cannot act or be acted
150	upon in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same
150	time, in contrary ways; and therefore whenever this contradiction
150	occurs in things apparently the same, we know that they are really not
150	the same, but different.
150	
150	Good.
150	
150	For example, I said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the
150	same time in the same part?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	Still, I said, let us have a more precise statement of terms, lest we
150	should hereafter fall out by the way.  Imagine the case of a man who is
150	standing and also moving his hands and his head, and suppose a person
150	to say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the
150	same moment-to such a mode of speech we should object, and should
150	rather say that one part of him is in motion while another is at rest.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And suppose the objector to refine still further, and to draw the nice
150	distinction that not only parts of tops, but whole tops, when they spin
150	round with their pegs fixed on the spot, are at rest and in motion at
150	the same time (and he may say the same of anything which revolves in
150	the same spot), his objection would not be admitted by us, because in
150	such cases things are not at rest and in motion in the same parts of
150	themselves; we should rather say that they have both an axis and a
150	circumference, and that the axis stands still, for there is no
150	deviation from the perpendicular; and that the circumference goes
150	round.  But if, while revolving, the axis inclines either to the right
150	or left, forwards or backwards, then in no point of view can they be at
150	rest.
150	
150	That is the correct mode of describing them, he replied.
150	
150	Then none of these objections will confuse us, or incline us to believe
150	that the same thing at the same time, in the same part or in relation
150	to the same thing, can act or be acted upon in contrary ways.
150	
150	Certainly not, according to my way of thinking.
150	
150	Yet, I said, that we may not be compelled to examine all such
150	objections, and prove at length that they are untrue, let us assume
150	their absurdity, and go forward on the understanding that hereafter, if
150	this assumption turn out to be untrue, all the consequences which
150	follow shall be withdrawn.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that will be the best way.
150	
150	Well, I said, would you not allow that assent and dissent, desire and
150	aversion, attraction and repulsion, are all of them opposites, whether
150	they are regarded as active or passive (for that makes no difference in
150	the fact of their opposition)?
150	
150	Yes, he said, they are opposites.
150	
150	Well, I said, and hunger and thirst, and the desires in general, and
150	again willing and wishing,--all these you would refer to the classes
150	already mentioned.  You would say--would you not?--that the soul of him
150	who desires is seeking after the object of his desires; or that he is
150	drawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess: or again, when
150	a person wants anything to be given him, his mind, longing for the
150	realisation of his desires, intimates his wish to have it by a nod of
150	assent, as if he had been asked a question?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence of
150	desire; should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion
150	and rejection?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Admitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a
150	particular class of desires, and out of these we will select hunger and
150	thirst, as they are termed, which are the most obvious of them?
150	
150	Let us take that class, he said.
150	
150	The object of one is food, and of the other drink?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And here comes the point:  is not thirst the desire which the soul has
150	of drink, and of drink only; not of drink qualified by anything else;
150	for example, warm or cold, or much or little, or, in a word, drink of
150	any particular sort:  but if the thirst be accompanied by heat, then
150	the desire is of cold drink; or, if accompanied by cold, then of warm
150	drink; or, if the thirst be excessive, then the drink which is desired
150	will be excessive; or, if not great, the quantity of drink will also be
150	small:  but thirst pure and simple will desire drink pure and simple,
150	which is the natural satisfaction of thirst, as food is of hunger?
150	
150	Yes, he said; the simple desire is, as you say, in every case of the
150	simple object, and the qualified desire of the qualified object.
150	
150	But here a confusion may arise; and I should wish to guard against an
150	opponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only, but
150	good drink, or food only, but good food; for good is the universal
150	object of desire, and thirst being a desire, will necessarily be thirst
150	after good drink; and the same is true of every other desire.
150	
150	Yes, he replied, the opponent might have something to say.
150	
150	Nevertheless I should still maintain, that of relatives some have a
150	quality attached to either term of the relation; others are simple and
150	have their correlatives simple.
150	
150	I do not know what you mean.
150	
150	Well, you know of course that the greater is relative to the less?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And the much greater to the much less?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that is
150	to be to the less that is to be?
150	
150	Certainly, he said.
150	
150	And so of more and less, and of other correlative terms, such as the
150	double and the half, or again, the heavier and the lighter, the swifter
150	and the slower; and of hot and cold, and of any other relatives;--is
150	not this true of all of them?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And does not the same principle hold in the sciences?  The object of
150	science is knowledge (assuming that to be the true definition), but the
150	object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge; I
150	mean, for example, that the science of house-building is a kind of
150	knowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is
150	therefore termed architecture.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Because it has a particular quality which no other has?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And it has this particular quality because it has an object of a
150	particular kind; and this is true of the other arts and sciences?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Now, then, if I have made myself clear, you will understand my original
150	meaning in what I said about relatives.  My meaning was, that if one
150	term of a relation is taken alone, the other is taken alone; if one
150	term is qualified, the other is also qualified.  I do not mean to say
150	that relatives may not be disparate, or that the science of health is
150	healthy, or of disease necessarily diseased, or that the sciences of
150	good and evil are therefore good and evil; but only that, when the term
150	science is no longer used absolutely, but has a qualified object which
150	in this case is the nature of health and disease, it becomes defined,
150	and is hence called not merely science, but the science of medicine.
150	
150	I quite understand, and I think as you do.
150	
150	Would you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative
150	terms, having clearly a relation--
150	
150	Yes, thirst is relative to drink.
150	
150	And a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink;
150	but thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little, nor of good nor
150	bad, nor of any particular kind of drink, but of drink only?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Then the soul of the thirsty one, in so far as he is thirsty, desires
150	only drink; for this he yearns and tries to obtain it?
150	
150	That is plain.
150	
150	And if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from
150	drink, that must be different from the thirsty principle which draws
150	him like a beast to drink; for, as we were saying, the same thing
150	cannot at the same time with the same part of itself act in contrary
150	ways about the same.
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	No more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull the
150	bow at the same time, but what you say is that one hand pushes and the
150	other pulls.
150	
150	Exactly so, he replied.
150	
150	And might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?
150	
150	Yes, he said, it constantly happens.
150	
150	And in such a case what is one to say?  Would you not say that there
150	was something in the soul bidding a man to drink, and something else
150	forbidding him, which is other and stronger than the principle which
150	bids him?
150	
150	I should say so.
150	
150	And the forbidding principle is derived from reason, and that which
150	bids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease?
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	Then we may fairly assume that they are two, and that they differ from
150	one another; the one with which man reasons, we may call the rational
150	principle of the soul, the other, with which he loves and hungers and
150	thirsts and feels the flutterings of any other desire, may be termed
150	the irrational or appetitive, the ally of sundry pleasures and
150	satisfactions?
150	
150	Yes, he said, we may fairly assume them to be different.
150	
150	Then let us finally determine that there are two principles existing in
150	the soul.  And what of passion, or spirit?  Is it a third, or akin to
150	one of the preceding?
150	
150	I should be inclined to say--akin to desire.
150	
150	Well, I said, there is a story which I remember to have heard, and in
150	which I put faith.  The story is, that Leontius, the son of Aglaion,
150	coming up one day from the Piraeus, under the north wall on the
150	outside, observed some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of
150	execution.  He felt a desire to see them, and also a dread and
150	abhorrence of them; for a time he struggled and covered his eyes, but
150	at length the desire got the better of him; and forcing them open, he
150	ran up to the dead bodies, saying, Look, ye wretches, take your fill of
150	the fair sight.
150	
150	I have heard the story myself, he said.
150	
150	The moral of the tale is, that anger at times goes to war with desire,
150	as though they were two distinct things.
150	
150	Yes; that is the meaning, he said.
150	
150	And are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a
150	man's desires violently prevail over his reason, he reviles himself,
150	and is angry at the violence within him, and that in this struggle,
150	which is like the struggle of factions in a State, his spirit is on the
150	side of his reason;--but for the passionate or spirited element to take
150	part with the desires when reason that she should not be opposed, is a
150	sort of thing which thing which I believe that you never observed
150	occurring in yourself, nor, as I should imagine, in any one else?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another, the nobler he
150	is the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering, such as
150	hunger, or cold, or any other pain which the injured person may inflict
150	upon him--these he deems to be just, and, as I say, his anger refuses
150	to be excited by them.
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	But when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong, then he boils
150	and chafes, and is on the side of what he believes to be justice; and
150	because he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more
150	determined to persevere and conquer.  His noble spirit will not be
150	quelled until he either slays or is slain; or until he hears the voice
150	of the shepherd, that is, reason, bidding his dog bark no more.
150	
150	The illustration is perfect, he replied; and in our State, as we were
150	saying, the auxiliaries were to be dogs, and to hear the voice of the
150	rulers, who are their shepherds.
150	
150	I perceive, I said, that you quite understand me; there is, however, a
150	further point which I wish you to consider.
150	
150	What point?
150	
150	You remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a
150	kind of desire, but now we should say quite the contrary; for in the
150	conflict of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational
150	principle.
150	
150	Most assuredly.
150	
150	But a further question arises:  Is passion different from reason also,
150	or only a kind of reason; in which latter case, instead of three
150	principles in the soul, there will only be two, the rational and the
150	concupiscent; or rather, as the State was composed of three classes,
150	traders, auxiliaries, counsellors, so may there not be in the
150	individual soul a third element which is passion or spirit, and when
150	not corrupted by bad education is the natural auxiliary of reason
150	
150	Yes, he said, there must be a third.
150	
150	Yes, I replied, if passion, which has already been shown to be
150	different from desire, turn out also to be different from reason.
150	
150	But that is easily proved:--We may observe even in young children that
150	they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born, whereas some
150	of them never seem to attain to the use of reason, and most of them
150	late enough.
150	
150	Excellent, I said, and you may see passion equally in brute animals,
150	which is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying.  And we
150	may once more appeal to the words of Homer, which have been already
150	quoted by us,
150	
150	    He smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul,
150	
150	for in this verse Homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons
150	about the better and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger
150	which is rebuked by it.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	And so, after much tossing, we have reached land, and are fairly agreed
150	that the same principles which exist in the State exist also in the
150	individual, and that they are three in number.
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	Must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way, and
150	in virtue of the same quality which makes the State wise?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the State
150	constitutes courage in the individual, and that both the State and the
150	individual bear the same relation to all the other virtues?
150	
150	Assuredly.
150	
150	And the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same
150	way in which the State is just?
150	
150	That follows, of course.
150	
150	We cannot but remember that the justice of the State consisted in each
150	of the three classes doing the work of its own class?
150	
150	We are not very likely to have forgotten, he said.
150	
150	We must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of
150	his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?
150	
150	Yes, he said, we must remember that too.
150	
150	And ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care
150	of the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to
150	be the subject and ally?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And, as we were saying, the united influence of music and gymnastic
150	will bring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the reason with
150	noble words and lessons, and moderating and soothing and civilizing the
150	wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm?
150	
150	Quite true, he said.
150	
150	And these two, thus nurtured and educated, and having learned truly to
150	know their own functions, will rule over the concupiscent, which in
150	each of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most
150	insatiable of gain; over this they will keep guard, lest, waxing great
150	and strong with the fulness of bodily pleasures, as they are termed,
150	the concupiscent soul, no longer confined to her own sphere, should
150	attempt to enslave and rule those who are not her natural-born
150	subjects, and overturn the whole life of man?
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	Both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and
150	the whole body against attacks from without; the one counselling, and
150	the other fighting under his leader, and courageously executing his
150	commands and counsels?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and
150	in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear?
150	
150	Right, he replied.
150	
150	And him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, and
150	which proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to have a
150	knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of
150	the whole?
150	
150	Assuredly.
150	
150	And would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements
150	in friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and
150	the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that
150	reason ought to rule, and do not rebel?
150	
150	Certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether in
150	the State or individual.
150	
150	And surely, I said, we have explained again and again how and by virtue
150	of what quality a man will be just.
150	
150	That is very certain.
150	
150	And is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form different, or
150	is she the same which we found her to be in the State?
150	
150	There is no difference in my opinion, he said.
150	
150	Because, if any doubt is still lingering in our minds, a few
150	commonplace instances will satisfy us of the truth of what I am saying.
150	
150	What sort of instances do you mean?
150	
150	If the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just State, or the
150	man who is trained in the principles of such a State, will be less
150	likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver?
150	Would any one deny this?
150	
150	No one, he replied.
150	
150	Will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft, or
150	treachery either to his friends or to his country?
150	
150	Never.
150	
150	Neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or
150	agreements?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	No one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his
150	father and mother, or to fall in his religious duties?
150	
150	No one.
150	
150	And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business,
150	whether in ruling or being ruled?
150	
150	Exactly so.
150	
150	Are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such
150	states is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?
150	
150	Not I, indeed.
150	
150	Then our dream has been realised; and the suspicion which we
150	entertained at the beginning of our work of construction, that some
150	divine power must have conducted us to a primary form of justice, has
150	now been verified?
150	
150	Yes, certainly.
150	
150	And the division of labour which required the carpenter and the
150	shoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own
150	business, and not another's, was a shadow of justice, and for that
150	reason it was of use?
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	But in reality justice was such as we were describing, being concerned
150	however, not with the outward man, but with the inward, which is the
150	true self and concernment of man:  for the just man does not permit the
150	several elements within him to interfere with one another, or any of
150	them to do the work of others,--he sets in order his own inner life,
150	and is his own master and his own law, and at peace with himself; and
150	when he has bound together the three principles within him, which may
150	be compared to the higher, lower, and middle notes of the scale, and
150	the intermediate intervals--when he has bound all these together, and
150	is no longer many, but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly
150	adjusted nature, then he proceeds to act, if he has to act, whether in
150	a matter of property, or in the treatment of the body, or in some
150	affair of politics or private business; always thinking and calling
150	that which preserves and co-operates with this harmonious condition,
150	just and good action, and the knowledge which presides over it, wisdom,
150	and that which at any time impairs this condition, he will call unjust
150	action, and the opinion which presides over it ignorance.
150	
150	You have said the exact truth, Socrates.
150	
150	Very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man
150	and the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we
150	should not be telling a falsehood?
150	
150	Most certainly not.
150	
150	May we say so, then?
150	
150	Let us say so.
150	
150	And now, I said, injustice has to be considered.
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	Must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three
150	principles--a meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part
150	of the soul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority,
150	which is made by a rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he
150	is the natural vassal,--what is all this confusion and delusion but
150	injustice, and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance, and every form
150	of vice?
150	
150	Exactly so.
150	
150	And if the nature of justice and injustice be known, then the meaning
150	of acting unjustly and being unjust, or, again, of acting justly, will
150	also be perfectly clear?
150	
150	What do you mean? he said.
150	
150	Why, I said, they are like disease and health; being in the soul just
150	what disease and health are in the body.
150	
150	How so? he said.
150	
150	Why, I said, that which is healthy causes health, and that which is
150	unhealthy causes disease.
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause injustice?
150	
150	That is certain.
150	
150	And the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and
150	government of one by another in the parts of the body; and the creation
150	of disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this
150	natural order?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order
150	and government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the
150	creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance
150	with the natural order?
150	
150	Exactly so, he said.
150	
150	Then virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and
150	vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?
150	
150	Assuredly.
150	
150	Still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and
150	injustice has not been answered:  Which is the more profitable, to be
150	just and act justly and practise virtue, whether seen or unseen of gods
150	and men, or to be unjust and act unjustly, if only unpunished and
150	unreformed?
150	
150	In my judgment, Socrates, the question has now become ridiculous.  We
150	know that, when the bodily constitution is gone, life is no longer
150	endurable, though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks, and
150	having all wealth and all power; and shall we be told that when the
150	very essence of the vital principle is undermined and corrupted, life
150	is still worth having to a man, if only he be allowed to do whatever he
150	likes with the single exception that he is not to acquire justice and
150	virtue, or to escape from injustice and vice; assuming them both to be
150	such as we have described?
150	
150	Yes, I said, the question is, as you say, ridiculous.  Still, as we are
150	near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner with
150	our own eyes, let us not faint by the way.
150	
150	Certainly not, he replied.
150	
150	Come up hither, I said, and behold the various forms of vice, those of
150	them, I mean, which are worth looking at.
150	
150	I am following you, he replied:  proceed.
150	
150	I said, The argument seems to have reached a height from which, as from
150	some tower of speculation, a man may look down and see that virtue is
150	one, but that the forms of vice are innumerable; there being four
150	special ones which are deserving of note.
150	
150	What do you mean? he said.
150	
150	I mean, I replied, that there appear to be as many forms of the soul as
150	there are distinct forms of the State.
150	
150	How many?
150	
150	There are five of the State, and five of the soul, I said.
150	
150	What are they?
150	
150	The first, I said, is that which we have been describing, and which may
150	be said to have two names, monarchy and aristocracy, accordingly as
150	rule is exercised by one distinguished man or by many.
150	
150	True, he replied.
150	
150	But I regard the two names as describing one form only; for whether the
150	government is in the hands of one or many, if the governors have been
150	trained in the manner which we have supposed, the fundamental laws of
150	the State will be maintained.
150	
150	That is true, he replied.
150	
150	
150	
150	
150	BOOK V
150	
150	
150	SOCRATES - GLAUCON - ADEIMANTUS
150	
150	SUCH is the good and true City or State, and the good and man is of the
150	same pattern; and if this is right every other is wrong; and the evil
150	is one which affects not only the ordering of the State, but also the
150	regulation of the individual soul, and is exhibited in four forms.
150	
150	What are they? he said.
150	
150	I was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms
150	appeared to me to succeed one another, when Pole marchus, who was
150	sitting a little way off, just beyond Adeimantus, began to whisper to
150	him: stretching forth his hand, he took hold of the upper part of his
150	coat by the shoulder, and drew him towards him, leaning forward himself
150	so as to be quite close and saying something in his ear, of which I
150	only caught the words, 'Shall we let him off, or what shall we do?'
150	
150	Certainly not, said Adeimantus, raising his voice.
150	
150	Who is it, I said, whom you are refusing to let off?
150	
150	You, he said.
150	
150	I repeated, Why am I especially not to be let off?
150	
150	Why, he said, we think that you are lazy, and mean to cheat us out of a
150	whole chapter which is a very important part of the story; and you
150	fancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding; as if it
150	were self-evident to everybody, that in the matter of women and
150	children 'friends have all things in common.'
150	
150	And was I not right, Adeimantus?
150	
150	Yes, he said; but what is right in this particular case, like
150	everything else, requires to be explained; for community may be of many
150	kinds.  Please, therefore, to say what sort of community you mean.  We
150	have been long expecting that you would tell us something about the
150	family life of your citizens--how they will bring children into the
150	world, and rear them when they have arrived, and, in general, what is
150	the nature of this community of women and children-for we are of
150	opinion that the right or wrong management of such matters will have a
150	great and paramount influence on the State for good or for evil.  And
150	now, since the question is still undetermined, and you are taking in
150	hand another State, we have resolved, as you heard, not to let you go
150	until you give an account of all this.
150	
150	To that resolution, said Glaucon, you may regard me as saying Agreed.
150	
150	SOCRATES - ADEIMANTUS - GLAUCON - THRASYMACHUS
150	
150	And without more ado, said Thrasymachus, you may consider us all to be
150	equally agreed.
150	
150	I said, You know not what you are doing in thus assailing me: What an
150	argument are you raising about the State!  Just as I thought that I had
150	finished, and was only too glad that I had laid this question to sleep,
150	and was reflecting how fortunate I was in your acceptance of what I
150	then said, you ask me to begin again at the very foundation, ignorant
150	of what a hornet's nest of words you are stirring.  Now I foresaw this
150	gathering trouble, and avoided it.
150	
150	For what purpose do you conceive that we have come here, said
150	Thrasymachus,--to look for gold, or to hear discourse?
150	
150	Yes, but discourse should have a limit.
150	
150	Yes, Socrates, said Glaucon, and the whole of life is the only limit
150	which wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses.  But never
150	mind about us; take heart yourself and answer the question in your own
150	way: What sort of community of women and children is this which is to
150	prevail among our guardians? and how shall we manage the period between
150	birth and education, which seems to require the greatest care?  Tell us
150	how these things will be.
150	
150	Yes, my simple friend, but the answer is the reverse of easy; many more
150	doubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions.  For the
150	practicability of what is said may be doubted; and looked at in another
150	point of view, whether the scheme, if ever so practicable, would be for
150	the best, is also doubtful.  Hence I feel a reluctance to approach the
150	subject, lest our aspiration, my dear friend, should turn out to be a
150	dream only.
150	
150	Fear not, he replied, for your audience will not be hard upon you; they
150	are not sceptical or hostile.
150	
150	I said:  My good friend, I suppose that you mean to encourage me by
150	these words.
150	
150	Yes, he said.
150	
150	Then let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse; the
150	encouragement which you offer would have been all very well had I
150	myself believed that I knew what I was talking about: to declare the
150	truth about matters of high interest which a man honours and loves
150	among wise men who love him need occasion no fear or faltering in his
150	mind; but to carry on an argument when you are yourself only a
150	hesitating enquirer, which is my condition, is a dangerous and slippery
150	thing; and the danger is not that I shall be laughed at (of which the
150	fear would be childish), but that I shall miss the truth where I have
150	most need to be sure of my footing, and drag my friends after me in my
150	fall.  And I pray Nemesis not to visit upon me the words which I am
150	going to utter.  For I do indeed believe that to be an involuntary
150	homicide is a less crime than to be a deceiver about beauty or goodness
150	or justice in the matter of laws.  And that is a risk which I would
150	rather run among enemies than among friends, and therefore you do well
150	to encourage me.
150	
150	Glaucon laughed and said:  Well then, Socrates, in case you and your
150	argument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand of
150	the and shall not be held to be a deceiver; take courage then and speak.
150	
150	Well, I said, the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free from
150	guilt, and what holds at law may hold in argument.
150	
150	Then why should you mind?
150	
150	Well, I replied, I suppose that I must retrace my steps and say what I
150	perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place.  The part of the
150	men has been played out, and now properly enough comes the turn of the
150	women.  Of them I will proceed to speak, and the more readily since I
150	am invited by you.
150	
150	For men born and educated like our citizens, the only way, in my
150	opinion, of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use
150	of women and children is to follow the path on which we originally
150	started, when we said that the men were to be the guardians and
150	watchdogs of the herd.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be
150	subject to similar or nearly similar regulations; then we shall see
150	whether the result accords with our design.
150	
150	What do you mean?
150	
150	What I mean may be put into the form of a question, I said: Are dogs
150	divided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting and
150	in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs? or do we entrust to
150	the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks, while we leave
150	the females at home, under the idea that the bearing and suckling their
150	puppies is labour enough for them?
150	
150	No, he said, they share alike; the only difference between them is that
150	the males are stronger and the females weaker.
150	
150	But can you use different animals for the same purpose, unless they are
150	bred and fed in the same way?
150	
150	You cannot.
150	
150	Then, if women are to have the same duties as men, they must have the
150	same nurture and education?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	The education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic.
150	Yes.
150	
150	Then women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of war,
150	which they must practise like the men?
150	
150	That is the inference, I suppose.
150	
150	I should rather expect, I said, that several of our proposals, if they
150	are carried out, being unusual, may appear ridiculous.
150	
150	No doubt of it.
150	
150	Yes, and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women
150	naked in the palaestra, exercising with the men, especially when they
150	are no longer young; they certainly will not be a vision of beauty, any
150	more than the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and
150	ugliness continue to frequent the gymnasia.
150	
150	Yes, indeed, he said:  according to present notions the proposal would
150	be thought ridiculous.
150	
150	But then, I said, as we have determined to speak our minds, we must not
150	fear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of
150	innovation; how they will talk of women's attainments both in music and
150	gymnastic, and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon
150	horseback!
150	
150	Very true, he replied.
150	
150	Yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law; at
150	the same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be
150	serious.  Not long ago, as we shall remind them, the Hellenes were of
150	the opinion, which is still generally received among the barbarians,
150	that the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper; and when
150	first the Cretans and then the Lacedaemonians introduced the custom,
150	the wits of that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation.
150	
150	No doubt.
150	
150	But when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far
150	better than to cover them up, and the ludicrous effect to the outward
150	eye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted, then
150	the man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his
150	ridicule at any other sight but that of folly and vice, or seriously
150	inclines to weigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of the
150	good.
150	
150	Very true, he replied.
150	
150	First, then, whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest,
150	let us come to an understanding about the nature of woman:  Is she
150	capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men, or
150	not at all?  And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can
150	or can not share?  That will be the best way of commencing the enquiry,
150	and will probably lead to the fairest conclusion.
150	
150	That will be much the best way.
150	
150	Shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against
150	ourselves; in this manner the adversary's position will not be
150	undefended.
150	
150	Why not? he said.
150	
150	Then let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents.  They will
150	say: 'Socrates and Glaucon, no adversary need convict you, for you
150	yourselves, at the first foundation of the State, admitted the
150	principle that everybody was to do the one work suited to his own
150	nature.' And certainly, if I am not mistaken, such an admission was
150	made by us.  'And do not the natures of men and women differ very much
150	indeed?' And we shall reply:  Of course they do.  Then we shall be
150	asked, 'Whether the tasks assigned to men and to women should not be
150	different, and such as are agreeable to their different natures?'
150	Certainly they should.  'But if so, have you not fallen into a serious
150	inconsistency in saying that men and women, whose natures are so
150	entirely different, ought to perform the same actions?'-- What defence
150	will you make for us, my good Sir, against any one who offers these
150	objections?
150	
150	That is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly; and I shall
150	and I do beg of you to draw out the case on our side.
150	
150	These are the objections, Glaucon, and there are many others of a like
150	kind, which I foresaw long ago; they made me afraid and reluctant to
150	take in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and
150	children.
150	
150	By Zeus, he said, the problem to be solved is anything but easy.
150	
150	Why yes, I said, but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth,
150	whether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid-ocean, he
150	has to swim all the same.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And must not we swim and try to reach the shore:  we will hope that
150	Arion's dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us?
150	
150	I suppose so, he said.
150	
150	Well then, let us see if any way of escape can be found.  We
150	acknowledged--did we not? that different natures ought to have
150	different pursuits, and that men's and women's natures are different.
150	And now what are we saying?--that different natures ought to have the
150	same pursuits,--this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us.
150	
150	Precisely.
150	
150	Verily, Glaucon, I said, glorious is the power of the art of
150	contradiction!
150	
150	Why do you say so?
150	
150	Because I think that many a man falls into the practice against his
150	will.  When he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing, just
150	because he cannot define and divide, and so know that of which he is
150	speaking; and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit
150	of contention and not of fair discussion.
150	
150	Yes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to do
150	with us and our argument?
150	
150	A great deal; for there is certainly a danger of our getting
150	unintentionally into a verbal opposition.
150	
150	In what way?
150	
150	Why, we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, that
150	different natures ought to have different pursuits, but we never
150	considered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of
150	nature, or why we distinguished them when we assigned different
150	pursuits to different natures and the same to the same natures.
150	
150	Why, no, he said, that was never considered by us.
150	
150	I said:  Suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the
150	question whether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men
150	and hairy men; and if this is admitted by us, then, if bald men are
150	cobblers, we should forbid the hairy men to be cobblers, and conversely?
150	
150	That would be a jest, he said.
150	
150	Yes, I said, a jest; and why? because we never meant when we
150	constructed the State, that the opposition of natures should extend to
150	every difference, but only to those differences which affected the
150	pursuit in which the individual is engaged; we should have argued, for
150	example, that a physician and one who is in mind a physician may be
150	said to have the same nature.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Whereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And if, I said, the male and female sex appear to differ in their
150	fitness for any art or pursuit, we should say that such pursuit or art
150	ought to be assigned to one or the other of them; but if the difference
150	consists only in women bearing and men begetting children, this does
150	not amount to a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of the
150	sort of education she should receive; and we shall therefore continue
150	to maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same
150	pursuits.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	Next, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any of the
150	pursuits or arts of civic life, the nature of a woman differs from that
150	of a man?
150	
150	That will be quite fair.
150	
150	And perhaps he, like yourself, will reply that to give a sufficient
150	answer on the instant is not easy; but after a little reflection there
150	is no difficulty.
150	
150	Yes, perhaps.
150	
150	Suppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument, and
150	then we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the
150	constitution of women which would affect them in the administration of
150	the State.
150	
150	By all means.
150	
150	Let us say to him:  Come now, and we will ask you a question:--when you
150	spoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect, did you mean to
150	say that one man will acquire a thing easily, another with difficulty;
150	a little learning will lead the one to discover a great deal; whereas
150	the other, after much study and application, no sooner learns than he
150	forgets; or again, did you mean, that the one has a body which is a
150	good servant to his mind, while the body of the other is a hindrance to
150	him?-would not these be the sort of differences which distinguish the
150	man gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted?
150	
150	No one will deny that.
150	
150	And can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has
150	not all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female?
150	Need I waste time in speaking of the art of weaving, and the management
150	of pancakes and preserves, in which womankind does really appear to be
150	great, and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the
150	most absurd?
150	
150	You are quite right, he replied, in maintaining the general inferiority
150	of the female sex:  although many women are in many things superior to
150	many men, yet on the whole what you say is true.
150	
150	And if so, my friend, I said, there is no special faculty of
150	administration in a state which a woman has because she is a woman, or
150	which a man has by virtue of his sex, but the gifts of nature are alike
150	diffused in both; all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women
150	also, but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on
150	women?
150	
150	That will never do.
150	
150	One woman has a gift of healing, another not; one is a musician, and
150	another has no music in her nature?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and
150	another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And one woman is a philosopher, and another is an enemy of philosophy;
150	one has spirit, and another is without spirit?
150	
150	That is also true.
150	
150	Then one woman will have the temper of a guardian, and another not.
150	Was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences
150	of this sort?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Men and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian; they
150	differ only in their comparative strength or weakness.
150	
150	Obviously.
150	
150	And those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the
150	companions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom
150	they resemble in capacity and in character?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?
150	
150	They ought.
150	
150	Then, as we were saying before, there is nothing unnatural in assigning
150	music and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians--to that point we
150	come round again.
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	The law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature, and therefore
150	not an impossibility or mere aspiration; and the contrary practice,
150	which prevails at present, is in reality a violation of nature.
150	
150	That appears to be true.
150	
150	We had to consider, first, whether our proposals were possible, and
150	secondly whether they were the most beneficial?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And the possibility has been acknowledged?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	The very great benefit has next to be established?
150	
150	Quite so.
150	
150	You will admit that the same education which makes a man a good
150	guardian will make a woman a good guardian; for their original nature
150	is the same?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	I should like to ask you a question.
150	
150	What is it?
150	
150	Would you say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man
150	better than another?
150	
150	The latter.
150	
150	And in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the
150	guardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more
150	perfect men, or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling?
150	
150	What a ridiculous question!
150	
150	You have answered me, I replied:  Well, and may we not further say that
150	our guardians are the best of our citizens?
150	
150	By far the best.
150	
150	And will not their wives be the best women?
150	
150	Yes, by far the best.
150	
150	And can there be anything better for the interests of the State than
150	that the men and women of a State should be as good as possible?
150	
150	There can be nothing better.
150	
150	And this is what the arts of music and gymnastic, when present in such
150	manner as we have described, will accomplish?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest
150	degree beneficial to the State?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Then let the wives of our guardians strip, for their virtue will be
150	their robe, and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of
150	their country; only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to
150	be assigned to the women, who are the weaker natures, but in other
150	respects their duties are to be the same.  And as for the man who
150	laughs at naked women exercising their bodies from the best of motives,
150	in his laughter he is plucking
150	
150	    A fruit of unripe wisdom,
150	
150	and he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at, or what he is
150	about;--for that is, and ever will be, the best of sayings, That the
150	useful is the noble and the hurtful is the base.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Here, then, is one difficulty in our law about women, which we may say
150	that we have now escaped; the wave has not swallowed us up alive for
150	enacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their
150	pursuits in common; to the utility and also to the possibility of this
150	arrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears witness.
150	
150	Yes, that was a mighty wave which you have escaped.
150	
150	Yes, I said, but a greater is coming; you will of this when you see the
150	next.
150	
150	Go on; let me see.
150	
150	The law, I said, which is the sequel of this and of all that has
150	preceded, is to the following effect,--'that the wives of our guardians
150	are to be common, and their children are to be common, and no parent is
150	to know his own child, nor any child his parent.'
150	
150	Yes, he said, that is a much greater wave than the other; and the
150	possibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more
150	questionable.
150	
150	I do not think, I said, that there can be any dispute about the very
150	great utility of having wives and children in common; the possibility
150	is quite another matter, and will be very much disputed.
150	
150	I think that a good many doubts may be raised about both.
150	
150	You imply that the two questions must be combined, I replied.  Now I
150	meant that you should admit the utility; and in this way, as I thought;
150	I should escape from one of them, and then there would remain only the
150	possibility.
150	
150	But that little attempt is detected, and therefore you will please to
150	give a defence of both.
150	
150	Well, I said, I submit to my fate.  Yet grant me a little favour: let
150	me feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of
150	feasting themselves when they are walking alone; for before they have
150	discovered any means of effecting their wishes--that is a matter which
150	never troubles them--they would rather not tire themselves by thinking
150	about possibilities; but assuming that what they desire is already
150	granted to them, they proceed with their plan, and delight in detailing
150	what they mean to do when their wish has come true--that is a way which
150	they have of not doing much good to a capacity which was never good for
150	much.  Now I myself am beginning to lose heart, and I should like, with
150	your permission, to pass over the question of possibility at present.
150	Assuming therefore the possibility of the proposal, I shall now proceed
150	to enquire how the rulers will carry out these arrangements, and I
150	shall demonstrate that our plan, if executed, will be of the greatest
150	benefit to the State and to the guardians.  First of all, then, if you
150	have no objection, I will endeavour with your help to consider the
150	advantages of the measure; and hereafter the question of possibility.
150	
150	I have no objection; proceed.
150	
150	First, I think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be
150	worthy of the name which they bear, there must be willingness to obey
150	in the one and the power of command in the other; the guardians must
150	themselves obey the laws, and they must also imitate the spirit of them
150	in any details which are entrusted to their care.
150	
150	That is right, he said.
150	
150	You, I said, who are their legislator, having selected the men, will
150	now select the women and give them to them;--they must be as far as
150	possible of like natures with them; and they must live in common houses
150	and meet at common meals, None of them will have anything specially his
150	or her own; they will be together, and will be brought up together, and
150	will associate at gymnastic exercises.  And so they will be drawn by a
150	necessity of their natures to have intercourse with each
150	other--necessity is not too strong a word, I think?
150	
150	Yes, he said;--necessity, not geometrical, but another sort of
150	necessity which lovers know, and which is far more convincing and
150	constraining to the mass of mankind.
150	
150	True, I said; and this, Glaucon, like all the rest, must proceed after
150	an orderly fashion; in a city of the blessed, licentiousness is an
150	unholy thing which the rulers will forbid.
150	
150	Yes, he said, and it ought not to be permitted.
150	
150	Then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the
150	highest degree, and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred?
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	And how can marriages be made most beneficial?--that is a question
150	which I put to you, because I see in your house dogs for hunting, and
150	of the nobler sort of birds not a few.  Now, I beseech you, do tell me,
150	have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?
150	
150	In what particulars?
150	
150	Why, in the first place, although they are all of a good sort, are not
150	some better than others?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And do you breed from them all indifferently, or do you take care to
150	breed from the best only?
150	
150	From the best.
150	
150	And do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe age?
150	
150	I choose only those of ripe age.
150	
150	And if care was not taken in the breeding, your dogs and birds would
150	greatly deteriorate?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And the same of horses and animals in general?
150	
150	Undoubtedly.
150	
150	Good heavens! my dear friend, I said, what consummate skill will our
150	rulers need if the same principle holds of the human species!
150	
150	Certainly, the same principle holds; but why does this involve any
150	particular skill?
150	
150	Because, I said, our rulers will often have to practise upon the body
150	corporate with medicines.  Now you know that when patients do not
150	require medicines, but have only to be put under a regimen, the
150	inferior sort of practitioner is deemed to be good enough; but when
150	medicine has to be given, then the doctor should be more of a man.
150	
150	That is quite true, he said; but to what are you alluding?
150	
150	I mean, I replied, that our rulers will find a considerable dose of
150	falsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects: we were
150	saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be
150	of advantage.
150	
150	And we were very right.
150	
150	And this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the
150	regulations of marriages and births.
150	
150	How so?
150	
150	Why, I said, the principle has been already laid down that the best of
150	either sex should be united with the best as often, and the inferior
150	with the inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear the
150	offspring of the one sort of union, but not of the other, if the flock
150	is to be maintained in first-rate condition.  Now these goings on must
150	be a secret which the rulers only know, or there will be a further
150	danger of our herd, as the guardians may be termed, breaking out into
150	rebellion.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring
150	together the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices will be offered and
150	suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets:  the number of weddings
150	is a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose
150	aim will be to preserve the average of population?  There are many
150	other things which they will have to consider, such as the effects of
150	wars and diseases and any similar agencies, in order as far as this is
150	possible to prevent the State from becoming either too large or too
150	small.
150	
150	Certainly, he replied.
150	
150	We shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less
150	worthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together, and
150	then they will accuse their own ill-luck and not the rulers.
150	
150	To be sure, he said.
150	
150	And I think that our braver and better youth, besides their other
150	honours and rewards, might have greater facilities of intercourse with
150	women given them; their bravery will be a reason, and such fathers
150	ought to have as many sons as possible.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And the proper officers, whether male or female or both, for offices
150	are to be held by women as well as by men--
150	
150	Yes--
150	
150	The proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the
150	pen or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who
150	dwell in a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior, or of
150	the better when they chance to be deformed, will be put away in some
150	mysterious, unknown place, as they should be.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be
150	kept pure.
150	
150	They will provide for their nurture, and will bring the mothers to the
150	fold when they are full of milk, taking the greatest possible care that
150	no mother recognizes her own child; and other wet-nurses may be engaged
150	if more are required.  Care will also be taken that the process of
150	suckling shall not be protracted too long; and the mothers will have no
150	getting up at night or other trouble, but will hand over all this sort
150	of thing to the nurses and attendants.
150	
150	You suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of it
150	when they are having children.
150	
150	Why, said I, and so they ought.  Let us, however, proceed with our
150	scheme.  We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And what is the prime of life?  May it not be defined as a period of
150	about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?
150	
150	Which years do you mean to include?
150	
150	A woman, I said, at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to
150	the State, and continue to bear them until forty; a man may begin at
150	five-and-twenty, when he has passed the point at which the pulse of
150	life beats quickest, and continue to beget children until he be
150	fifty-five.
150	
150	Certainly, he said, both in men and women those years are the prime of
150	physical as well as of intellectual vigour.
150	
150	Any one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public
150	hymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing;
150	the child of which he is the father, if it steals into life, will have
150	been conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers,
150	which at each hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole city will
150	offer, that the new generation may be better and more useful than their
150	good and useful parents, whereas his child will be the offspring of
150	darkness and strange lust.
150	
150	Very true, he replied.
150	
150	And the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed
150	age who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without
150	the sanction of the rulers; for we shall say that he is raising up a
150	bastard to the State, uncertified and unconsecrated.
150	
150	Very true, he replied.
150	
150	This applies, however, only to those who are within the specified age:
150	after that we allow them to range at will, except that a man may not
150	marry his daughter or his daughter's daughter, or his mother or his
150	mother's mother; and women, on the other hand, are prohibited from
150	marrying their sons or fathers, or son's son or father's father, and so
150	on in either direction.  And we grant all this, accompanying the
150	permission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may come into
150	being from seeing the light; and if any force a way to the birth, the
150	parents must understand that the offspring of such an union cannot be
150	maintained, and arrange accordingly.
150	
150	That also, he said, is a reasonable proposition.  But how will they
150	know who are fathers and daughters, and so on?
150	
150	They will never know.  The way will be this:--dating from the day of
150	the hymeneal, the bridegroom who was then married will call all the
150	male children who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards
150	his sons, and the female children his daughters, and they will call him
150	father, and he will call their children his grandchildren, and they
150	will call the elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers.  All who
150	were begotten at the time when their fathers and mothers came together
150	will be called their brothers and sisters, and these, as I was saying,
150	will be forbidden to inter-marry. This, however, is not to be
150	understood as an absolute prohibition of the marriage of brothers and
150	sisters; if the lot favours them, and they receive the sanction of the
150	Pythian oracle, the law will allow them.
150	
150	Quite right, he replied.
150	
150	Such is the scheme, Glaucon, according to which the guardians of our
150	State are to have their wives and families in common.  And now you
150	would have the argument show that this community is consistent with the
150	rest of our polity, and also that nothing can be better--would you not?
150	
150	Yes, certainly.
150	
150	Shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought
150	to be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the
150	organization of a State,--what is the greatest I good, and what is the
150	greatest evil, and then consider whether our previous description has
150	the stamp of the good or of the evil?
150	
150	By all means.
150	
150	Can there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and
150	plurality where unity ought to reign? or any greater good than the bond
150	of unity?
150	
150	There cannot.
150	
150	And there is unity where there is community of pleasures and
150	pains--where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions
150	of joy and sorrow?
150	
150	No doubt.
150	
150	Yes; and where there is no common but only private feeling a State is
150	disorganized--when you have one half of the world triumphing and the
150	other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the
150	citizens?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Such differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use of
150	the terms 'mine' and 'not mine,' 'his' and 'not his.'
150	
150	Exactly so.
150	
150	And is not that the best-ordered State in which the greatest number of
150	persons apply the terms 'mine' and 'not mine' in the same way to the
150	same thing?
150	
150	Quite true.
150	
150	Or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the
150	individual--as in the body, when but a finger of one of us is hurt, the
150	whole frame, drawn towards the soul as a center and forming one kingdom
150	under the ruling power therein, feels the hurt and sympathizes all
150	together with the part affected, and we say that the man has a pain in
150	his finger; and the same expression is used about any other part of the
150	body, which has a sensation of pain at suffering or of pleasure at the
150	alleviation of suffering.
150	
150	Very true, he replied; and I agree with you that in the best-ordered
150	State there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you
150	describe.
150	
150	Then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil, the
150	whole State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or
150	sorrow with him?
150	
150	Yes, he said, that is what will happen in a well-ordered State.
150	
150	It will now be time, I said, for us to return to our State and see
150	whether this or some other form is most in accordance with these
150	fundamental principles.
150	
150	Very good.
150	
150	Our State like every other has rulers and subjects?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	All of whom will call one another citizens?
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	But is there not another name which people give to their rulers in
150	other States?
150	
150	Generally they call them masters, but in democratic States they simply
150	call them rulers.
150	
150	And in our State what other name besides that of citizens do the people
150	give the rulers?
150	
150	They are called saviours and helpers, he replied.
150	
150	And what do the rulers call the people?
150	
150	Their maintainers and foster-fathers.
150	
150	And what do they call them in other States?
150	
150	Slaves.
150	
150	And what do the rulers call one another in other States?
150	
150	Fellow-rulers.
150	
150	And what in ours?
150	
150	Fellow-guardians.
150	
150	Did you ever know an example in any other State of a ruler who would
150	speak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not
150	being his friend?
150	
150	Yes, very often.
150	
150	And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an
150	interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	But would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as
150	a stranger?
150	
150	Certainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be regarded
150	by them either as a brother or sister, or father or mother, or son or
150	daughter, or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected
150	with him.
150	
150	Capital, I said; but let me ask you once more:  Shall they be a family
150	in name only; or shall they in all their actions be true to the name?
150	For example, in the use of the word 'father,' would the care of a
150	father be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to
150	him which the law commands; and is the violator of these duties to be
150	regarded as an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to
150	receive much good either at the hands of God or of man?  Are these to
150	be or not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in
150	their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to
150	be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk?
150	
150	These, he said, and none other; for what can be more ridiculous than
150	for them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not
150	to act in the spirit of them?
150	
150	Then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often
150	beard than in any other.  As I was describing before, when any one is
150	well or ill, the universal word will be with me 'it is well' or 'it is
150	ill.'
150	
150	Most true.
150	
150	And agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying
150	that they will have their pleasures and pains in common?
150	
150	Yes, and so they will.
150	
150	And they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will
150	alike call 'my own,' and having this common interest they will have a
150	common feeling of pleasure and pain?
150	
150	Yes, far more so than in other States.
150	
150	And the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of the
150	State, will be that the guardians will have a community of women and
150	children?
150	
150	That will be the chief reason.
150	
150	And this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as was
150	implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered State to the relation
150	of the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain?
150	
150	That we acknowledged, and very rightly.
150	
150	Then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly
150	the source of the greatest good to the State?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming,--that
150	the guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other property;
150	their pay was to be their food, which they were to receive from the
150	other citizens, and they were to have no private expenses; for we
150	intended them to preserve their true character of guardians.
150	
150	Right, he replied.
150	
150	Both the community of property and the community of families, as I am
150	saying, tend to make them more truly guardians; they will not tear the
150	city in pieces by differing about 'mine' and 'not mine;' each man
150	dragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his
150	own, where he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures
150	and pains; but all will be affected as far as may be by the same
150	pleasures and pains because they are all of one opinion about what is
150	near and dear to them, and therefore they all tend towards a common end.
150	
150	Certainly, he replied.
150	
150	And as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their
150	own, suits and complaints will have no existence among them; they will
150	be delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or
150	relations are the occasion.
150	
150	Of course they will.
150	
150	Neither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among
150	them.  For that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall
150	maintain to be honourable and right; we shall make the protection of
150	the person a matter of necessity.
150	
150	That is good, he said.
150	
150	Yes; and there is a further good in the law; viz.  that if a man has a
150	quarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there, and
150	not proceed to more dangerous lengths.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	To the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the
150	younger.
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	Nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any
150	other violence to an elder, unless the magistrates command him; nor
150	will he slight him in any way.  For there are two guardians, shame and
150	fear, mighty to prevent him:  shame, which makes men refrain from
150	laying hands on those who are to them in the relation of parents; fear,
150	that the injured one will be succoured by the others who are his
150	brothers, sons, one wi fathers.
150	
150	That is true, he replied.
150	
150	Then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace
150	with one another?
150	
150	Yes, there will be no want of peace.
150	
150	And as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be
150	no danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or
150	against one another.
150	
150	None whatever.
150	
150	I hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they will
150	be rid, for they are beneath notice:  such, for example, as the
150	flattery of the rich by the poor, and all the pains and pangs which men
150	experience in bringing up a family, and in finding money to buy
150	necessaries for their household, borrowing and then repudiating,
150	getting how they can, and giving the money into the hands of women and
150	slaves to keep--the many evils of so many kinds which people suffer in
150	this way are mean enough and obvious enough, and not worth speaking of.
150	
150	Yes, he said, a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that.
150	
150	And from all these evils they will be delivered, and their life will be
150	blessed as the life of Olympic victors and yet more blessed.
150	
150	How so?
150	
150	The Olympic victor, I said, is deemed happy in receiving a part only of
150	the blessedness which is secured to our citizens, who have won a more
150	glorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public
150	cost.  For the victory which they have won is the salvation of the
150	whole State; and the crown with which they and their children are
150	crowned is the fulness of all that life needs; they receive rewards
150	from the hands of their country while living, and after death have an
150	honourable burial.
150	
150	Yes, he said, and glorious rewards they are.
150	
150	Do you remember, I said, how in the course of the previous discussion
150	some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians
150	unhappy--they had nothing and might have possessed all things-to whom
150	we replied that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps hereafter
150	consider this question, but that, as at present advised, we would make
150	our guardians truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the State
150	with a view to the greatest happiness, not of any particular class, but
150	of the whole?
150	
150	Yes, I remember.
150	
150	And what do you say, now that the life of our protectors is made out to
150	be far better and nobler than that of Olympic victors--is the life of
150	shoemakers, or any other artisans, or of husbandmen, to be compared
150	with it?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	At the same time I ought here to repeat what I have said elsewhere,
150	that if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner
150	that he will cease to be a guardian, and is not content with this safe
150	and harmonious life, which, in our judgment, is of all lives the best,
150	but infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into
150	his head shall seek to appropriate the whole State to himself, then he
150	will have to learn how wisely Hesiod spoke, when he said, 'half is more
150	than the whole.'
150	
150	If he were to consult me, I should say to him:  Stay where you are,
150	when you have the offer of such a life.
150	
150	You agree then, I said, that men and women are to have a common way of
150	life such as we have described--common education, common children; and
150	they are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the
150	city or going out to war; they are to keep watch together, and to hunt
150	together like dogs; and always and in all things, as far as they are
150	able, women are to share with the men?  And in so doing they will do
150	what is best, and will not violate, but preserve the natural relation
150	of the sexes.
150	
150	I agree with you, he replied.
150	
150	The enquiry, I said, has yet to be made, whether such a community be
150	found possible--as among other animals, so also among men--and if
150	possible, in what way possible?
150	
150	You have anticipated the question which I was about to suggest.
150	
150	There is no difficulty, I said, in seeing how war will be carried on by
150	them.
150	
150	How?
150	
150	Why, of course they will go on expeditions together; and will take with
150	them any of their children who are strong enough, that, after the
150	manner of the artisan's child, they may look on at the work which they
150	will have to do when they are grown up; and besides looking on they
150	will have to help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their fathers
150	and mothers.  Did you never observe in the arts how the potters' boys
150	look on and help, long before they touch the wheel?
150	
150	Yes, I have.
150	
150	And shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in
150	giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than
150	our guardians will be?
150	
150	The idea is ridiculous, he said.
150	
150	There is also the effect on the parents, with whom, as with other
150	animals, the presence of their young ones will be the greatest
150	incentive to valour.
150	
150	That is quite true, Socrates; and yet if they are defeated, which may
150	often happen in war, how great the danger is! the children will be lost
150	as well as their parents, and the State will never recover.
150	
150	True, I said; but would you never allow them to run any risk?
150	
150	I am far from saying that.
150	
150	Well, but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some
150	occasion when, if they escape disaster, they will be the better for it?
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	Whether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their
150	youth is a very important matter, for the sake of which some risk may
150	fairly be incurred.
150	
150	Yes, very important.
150	
150	This then must be our first step,--to make our children spectators of
150	war; but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against
150	danger; then all will be well.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Their parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war, but
150	to know, as far as human foresight can, what expeditions are safe and
150	what dangerous?
150	
150	That may be assumed.
150	
150	And they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about
150	the dangerous ones?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who
150	will be their leaders and teachers?
150	
150	Very properly.
150	
150	Still, the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen; there is a good
150	deal of chance about them?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Then against such chances the children must be at once furnished with
150	wings, in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape.
150	
150	What do you mean? he said.
150	
150	I mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth, and
150	when they have learnt to ride, take them on horseback to see war: the
150	horses must be spirited and warlike, but the most tractable and yet the
150	swiftest that can be had.  In this way they will get an excellent view
150	of what is hereafter to be their own business; and if there is danger
150	they have only to follow their elder leaders and escape.
150	
150	I believe that you are right, he said.
150	
150	Next, as to war; what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one
150	another and to their enemies?  I should be inclined to propose that the
150	soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms, or is guilty of
150	any other act of cowardice, should be degraded into the rank of a
150	husbandman or artisan.  What do you think?
150	
150	By all means, I should say.
150	
150	And he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made a
150	present of to his enemies; he is their lawful prey, and let them do
150	what they like with him.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	But the hero who has distinguished himself, what shall be done to him?
150	In the first place, he shall receive honour in the army from his
150	youthful comrades; every one of them in succession shall crown him.
150	What do you say?
150	
150	I approve.
150	
150	And what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship?
150	
150	To that too, I agree.
150	
150	But you will hardly agree to my next proposal.
150	
150	What is your proposal?
150	
150	That he should kiss and be kissed by them.
150	
150	Most certainly, and I should be disposed to go further, and say: Let no
150	one whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the
150	expedition lasts.  So that if there be a lover in the army, whether his
150	love be youth or maiden, he may be more eager to win the prize of
150	valour.
150	
150	Capital, I said.  That the brave man is to have more wives than others
150	has been already determined:  and he is to have first choices in such
150	matters more than others, in order that he may have as many children as
150	possible?
150	
150	Agreed.
150	
150	Again, there is another manner in which, according to Homer, brave
150	youths should be honoured; for he tells how Ajax, after he had
150	distinguished himself in battle, was rewarded with long chines, which
150	seems to be a compliment appropriate to a hero in the flower of his
150	age, being not only a tribute of honour but also a very strengthening
150	thing.
150	
150	Most true, he said.
150	
150	Then in this, I said, Homer shall be our teacher; and we too, at
150	sacrifices and on the like occasions, will honour the brave according
150	to the measure of their valour, whether men or women, with hymns and
150	those other distinctions which we were mentioning; also with
150	
150	    seats of precedence, and meats and full cups;
150	
150	and in honouring them, we shall be at the same time training them.
150	
150	That, he replied, is excellent.
150	
150	Yes, I said; and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say, in
150	the first place, that he is of the golden race?
150	
150	To be sure.
150	
150	Nay, have we not the authority of Hesiod for affirming that when they
150	are dead
150	
150	    They are holy angels upon the earth, authors of good,
150	    averters of evil, the guardians of speech-gifted men?
150	
150	Yes; and we accept his authority.
150	
150	We must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine
150	and heroic personages, and what is to be their special distinction and
150	we must do as he bids?
150	
150	By all means.
150	
150	And in ages to come we will reverence them and kneel before their
150	sepulchres as at the graves of heroes.  And not only they but any who
150	are deemed pre-eminently good, whether they die from age, or in any
150	other way, shall be admitted to the same honours.
150	
150	That is very right, he said.
150	
150	Next, how shall our soldiers treat their enemies?  What about this?
150	
150	In what respect do you mean?
150	
150	First of all, in regard to slavery?  Do you think it right that
150	Hellenes should enslave Hellenic States, or allow others to enslave
150	them, if they can help?  Should not their custom be to spare them,
150	considering the danger which there is that the whole race may one day
150	fall under the yoke of the barbarians?
150	
150	To spare them is infinitely better.
150	
150	Then no Hellene should be owned by them as a slave; that is a rule
150	which they will observe and advise the other Hellenes to observe.
150	
150	Certainly, he said; they will in this way be united against the
150	barbarians and will keep their hands off one another.
150	
150	Next as to the slain; ought the conquerors, I said, to take anything
150	but their armour?  Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford
150	an excuse for not facing the battle?  Cowards skulk about the dead,
150	pretending that they are fulfilling a duty, and many an army before now
150	has been lost from this love of plunder.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse, and also
150	a degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead
150	body when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear
150	behind him,--is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his
150	assailant, quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead?
150	
150	Very like a dog, he said.
150	
150	Then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial?
150	
150	Yes, he replied, we most certainly must.
150	
150	Neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods, least of all
150	the arms of Hellenes, if we care to maintain good feeling with other
150	Hellenes; and, indeed, we have reason to fear that the offering of
150	spoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the
150	god himself?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Again, as to the devastation of Hellenic territory or the burning of
150	houses, what is to be the practice?
150	
150	May I have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?
150	
150	Both should be forbidden, in my judgment; I would take the annual
150	produce and no more.  Shall I tell you why?
150	
150	Pray do.
150	
150	Why, you see, there is a difference in the names 'discord' and 'war,'
150	and I imagine that there is also a difference in their natures; the one
150	is expressive of what is internal and domestic, the other of what is
150	external and foreign; and the first of the two is termed discord, and
150	only the second, war.
150	
150	That is a very proper distinction, he replied.
150	
150	And may I not observe with equal propriety that the Hellenic race is
150	all united together by ties of blood and friendship, and alien and
150	strange to the barbarians?
150	
150	Very good, he said.
150	
150	And therefore when Hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with
150	Hellenes, they will be described by us as being at war when they fight,
150	and by nature enemies, and this kind of antagonism should be called
150	war; but when Hellenes fight with one another we shall say that Hellas
150	is then in a state of disorder and discord, they being by nature
150	friends and such enmity is to be called discord.
150	
150	I agree.
150	
150	Consider then, I said, when that which we have acknowledged to be
150	discord occurs, and a city is divided, if both parties destroy the
150	lands and burn the houses of one another, how wicked does the strife
150	appear!  No true lover of his country would bring himself to tear in
150	pieces his own nurse and mother:  There might be reason in the
150	conqueror depriving the conquered of their harvest, but still they
150	would have the idea of peace in their hearts and would not mean to go
150	on fighting for ever.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that is a better temper than the other.
150	
150	And will not the city, which you are founding, be an Hellenic city?
150	
150	It ought to be, he replied.
150	
150	Then will not the citizens be good and civilized?
150	
150	Yes, very civilized.
150	
150	And will they not be lovers of Hellas, and think of Hellas as their own
150	land, and share in the common temples?
150	
150	Most certainly.
150	
150	And any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them as
150	discord only--a quarrel among friends, which is not to be called a war?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?
150	Certainly.
150	
150	They will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy
150	their opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies?
150	
150	Just so.
150	
150	And as they are Hellenes themselves they will not devastate Hellas, nor
150	will they burn houses, not even suppose that the whole population of a
150	city--men, women, and children--are equally their enemies, for they
150	know that the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that
150	the many are their friends.  And for all these reasons they will be
150	unwilling to waste their lands and raze their houses; their enmity to
150	them will only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled
150	the guilty few to give satisfaction?
150	
150	I agree, he said, that our citizens should thus deal with their
150	Hellenic enemies; and with barbarians as the Hellenes now deal with one
150	another.
150	
150	Then let us enact this law also for our guardians:-that they are
150	neither to devastate the lands of Hellenes nor to burn their houses.
150	
150	Agreed; and we may agree also in thinking that these, all our previous
150	enactments, are very good.
150	
150	But still I must say, Socrates, that if you are allowed to go on in
150	this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the
150	commencement of this discussion you thrust aside:--Is such an order of
150	things possible, and how, if at all?  For I am quite ready to
150	acknowledge that the plan which you propose, if only feasible, would do
150	all sorts of good to the State.  I will add, what you have omitted,
150	that your citizens will be the bravest of warriors, and will never
150	leave their ranks, for they will all know one another, and each will
150	call the other father, brother, son; and if you suppose the women to
150	join their armies, whether in the same rank or in the rear, either as a
150	terror to the enemy, or as auxiliaries in case of need, I know that
150	they will then be absolutely invincible; and there are many domestic
150	tic advantages which might also be mentioned and which I also fully
150	acknowledge: but, as I admit all these advantages and as many more as
150	you please, if only this State of yours were to come into existence, we
150	need say no more about them; assuming then the existence of the State,
150	let us now turn to the question of possibility and ways and means--the
150	rest may be left.
150	
150	If I loiter for a moment, you instantly make a raid upon me, I said,
150	and have no mercy; I have hardly escaped the first and second waves,
150	and you seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the
150	third, which is the greatest and heaviest.  When you have seen and
150	heard the third wave, I think you be more considerate and will
150	acknowledge that some fear and hesitation was natural respecting a
150	proposal so extraordinary as that which I have now to state and
150	investigate.
150	
150	The more appeals of this sort which you make, he said, the more
150	determined are we that you shall tell us how such a State is possible:
150	speak out and at once.
150	
150	Let me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the
150	search after justice and injustice.
150	
150	True, he replied; but what of that?
150	
150	I was only going to ask whether, if we have discovered them, we are to
150	require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice;
150	or may we be satisfied with an approximation, and the attainment in him
150	of a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men?
150	
150	The approximation will be enough.
150	
150	We are enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the
150	character of the perfectly just, and into injustice and the perfectly
150	unjust, that we might have an ideal.  We were to look at these in order
150	that we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to
150	the standard which they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled
150	them, but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact.
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	Would a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated with
150	consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was unable to
150	show that any such man could ever have existed?
150	
150	He would be none the worse.
150	
150	Well, and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect State?
150	
150	To be sure.
150	
150	And is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the
150	possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described?
150	
150	Surely not, he replied.
150	
150	That is the truth, I said.  But if, at your request, I am to try and
150	show how and under what conditions the possibility is highest, I must
150	ask you, having this in view, to repeat your former admissions.
150	
150	What admissions?
150	
150	I want to know whether ideals are ever fully realised in language?
150	Does not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual,
150	whatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short
150	of the truth?  What do you say?
150	
150	I agree.
150	
150	Then you must not insist on my proving that the actual State will in
150	every respect coincide with the ideal:  if we are only able to discover
150	how a city may be governed nearly as we proposed, you will admit that
150	we have discovered the possibility which you demand; and will be
150	contented.  I am sure that I should be contented--will not you?
150	
150	Yes, I will.
150	
150	Let me next endeavour to show what is that fault in States which is the
150	cause of their present maladministration, and what is the least change
150	which will enable a State to pass into the truer form; and let the
150	change, if possible, be of one thing only, or if not, of two; at any
150	rate, let the changes be as few and slight as possible.
150	
150	Certainly, he replied.
150	
150	I think, I said, that there might be a reform of the State if only one
150	change were made, which is not a slight or easy though still a possible
150	one.
150	
150	What is it? he said.
150	
150	Now then, I said, I go to meet that which I liken to the greatest of
150	the waves; yet shall the word be spoken, even though the wave break and
150	drown me in laughter and dishonour; and do you mark my words.
150	
150	Proceed.
150	
150	I said:  Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this
150	world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness
150	and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue either to
150	the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will
150	never have rest from their evils,--nor the human race, as I
150	believe,--and then only will this our State have a possibility of life
150	and behold the light of day.  Such was the thought, my dear Glaucon,
150	which I would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant;
150	for to be convinced that in no other State can there be happiness
150	private or public is indeed a hard thing.
150	
150	Socrates, what do you mean?  I would have you consider that the word
150	which you have uttered is one at which numerous persons, and very
150	respectable persons too, in a figure pulling off their coats all in a
150	moment, and seizing any weapon that comes to hand, will run at you
150	might and main, before you know where you are, intending to do heaven
150	knows what; and if you don't prepare an answer, and put yourself in
150	motion, you will be prepared by their fine wits,' and no mistake.
150	
150	You got me into the scrape, I said.
150	
150	And I was quite right; however, I will do all I can to get you out of
150	it; but I can only give you good-will and good advice, and, perhaps, I
150	may be able to fit answers to your questions better than another--that
150	is all.  And now, having such an auxiliary, you must do your best to
150	show the unbelievers that you are right.
150	
150	I ought to try, I said, since you offer me such invaluable assistance.
150	And I think that, if there is to be a chance of our escaping, we must
150	explain to them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to rule
150	in the State; then we shall be able to defend ourselves: There will be
150	discovered to be some natures who ought to study philosophy and to be
150	leaders in the State; and others who are not born to be philosophers,
150	and are meant to be followers rather than leaders.
150	
150	Then now for a definition, he said.
150	
150	Follow me, I said, and I hope that I may in some way or other be able
150	to give you a satisfactory explanation.
150	
150	Proceed.
150	
150	I dare say that you remember, and therefore I need not remind you, that
150	a lover, if lie is worthy of the name, ought to show his love, not to
150	some one part of that which he loves, but to the whole.
150	
150	I really do not understand, and therefore beg of you to assist my
150	memory.
150	
150	Another person, I said, might fairly reply as you do; but a man of
150	pleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of
150	youth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lover's breast,
150	and are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards.  Is
150	not this a way which you have with the fair:  one has a snub nose, and
150	you praise his charming face; the hook-nose of another has, you say, a
150	royal look; while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of
150	regularity:  the dark visage is manly, the fair are children of the
150	gods; and as to the sweet 'honey pale,' as they are called, what is the
150	very name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives, and is
150	not adverse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth?  In a word,
150	there is no excuse which you will not make, and nothing which you will
150	not say, in order not to lose a single flower that blooms in the
150	spring-time of youth.
150	
150	If you make me an authority in matters of love, for the sake of the
150	argument, I assent.
150	
150	And what do you say of lovers of wine?  Do you not see them doing the
150	same?  They are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine.
150	
150	Very good.
150	
150	And the same is true of ambitious men; if they cannot command an army,
150	they are willing to command a file; and if they cannot be honoured by
150	really great and important persons, they are glad to be honoured by
150	lesser and meaner people, but honour of some kind they must have.
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	Once more let me ask:  Does he who desires any class of goods, desire
150	the whole class or a part only?
150	
150	The whole.
150	
150	And may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover, not of a part
150	of wisdom only, but of the whole?
150	
150	Yes, of the whole.
150	
150	And he who dislikes learnings, especially in youth, when he has no
150	power of judging what is good and what is not, such an one we maintain
150	not to be a philosopher or a lover of knowledge, just as he who refuses
150	his food is not hungry, and may be said to have a bad appetite and not
150	a good one?
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	Whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is
150	curious to learn and is never satisfied, may be justly termed a
150	philosopher?  Am I not right?
150	
150	Glaucon said:  If curiosity makes a philosopher, you will find many a
150	strange being will have a title to the name.  All the lovers of sights
150	have a delight in learning, and must therefore be included.  Musical
150	amateurs, too, are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers,
150	for they are the last persons in the world who would come to anything
150	like a philosophical discussion, if they could help, while they run
150	about at the Dionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears to
150	hear every chorus; whether the performance is in town or country--that
150	makes no difference--they are there.  Now are we to maintain that all
150	these and any who have similar tastes, as well as the professors of
150	quite minor arts, are philosophers?
150	
150	Certainly not, I replied; they are only an imitation.
150	
150	He said:  Who then are the true philosophers?
150	
150	Those, I said, who are lovers of the vision of truth.
150	
150	That is also good, he said; but I should like to know what you mean?
150	
150	To another, I replied, I might have a difficulty in explaining; but I
150	am sure that you will admit a proposition which I am about to make.
150	
150	What is the proposition?
150	
150	That since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they are two?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And inasmuch as they are two, each of them is one?
150	
150	True again.
150	
150	And of just and unjust, good and evil, and of every other class, the
150	same remark holds:  taken singly, each of them one; but from the
150	various combinations of them with actions and things and with one
150	another, they are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many?  Very
150	true.
150	
150	And this is the distinction which I draw between the sight-loving,
150	art-loving, practical class and those of whom I am speaking, and who
150	are alone worthy of the name of philosophers.
150	
150	How do you distinguish them? he said.
150	
150	The lovers of sounds and sights, I replied, are, as I conceive, fond of
150	fine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that
150	are made out of them, but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving
150	absolute beauty.
150	
150	True, he replied.
150	
150	Few are they who are able to attain to the sight of this.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute
150	beauty, or who, if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is
150	unable to follow--of such an one I ask, Is he awake or in a dream only?
150	Reflect:  is not the dreamer, sleeping or waking, one who likens
150	dissimilar things, who puts the copy in the place of the real object?
150	
150	I should certainly say that such an one was dreaming.
150	
150	But take the case of the other, who recognises the existence of
150	absolute beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects
150	which participate in the idea, neither putting the objects in the place
150	of the idea nor the idea in the place of the objects--is he a dreamer,
150	or is he awake?
150	
150	He is wide awake.
150	
150	And may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge,
150	and that the mind of the other, who opines only, has opinion
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	But suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our
150	statement, can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him,
150	without revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits?
150	
150	We must certainly offer him some good advice, he replied.
150	
150	Come, then, and let us think of something to say to him.  Shall we
150	begin by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may
150	have, and that we are rejoiced at his having it?  But we should like to
150	ask him a question:  Does he who has knowledge know something or
150	nothing?  (You must answer for him.)
150	
150	I answer that he knows something.
150	
150	Something that is or is not?
150	
150	Something that is; for how can that which is not ever be known?
150	
150	And are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of
150	view, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that the
150	utterly non-existent is utterly unknown?
150	
150	Nothing can be more certain.
150	
150	Good.  But if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and
150	not to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being and
150	the absolute negation of being?
150	
150	Yes, between them.
150	
150	And, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to
150	not-being, for that intermediate between being and not-being there has
150	to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and
150	knowledge, if there be such?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Do we admit the existence of opinion?
150	
150	Undoubtedly.
150	
150	As being the same with knowledge, or another faculty?
150	
150	Another faculty.
150	
150	Then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter
150	corresponding to this difference of faculties?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And knowledge is relative to being and knows being.  But before I
150	proceed further I will make a division.
150	
150	What division?
150	
150	I will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves: they are
150	powers in us, and in all other things, by which we do as we do.  Sight
150	and hearing, for example, I should call faculties.  Have I clearly
150	explained the class which I mean?
150	
150	Yes, I quite understand.
150	
150	Then let me tell you my view about them.  I do not see them, and
150	therefore the distinctions of fire, colour, and the like, which enable
150	me to discern the differences of some things, do not apply to them.  In
150	speaking of a faculty I think only of its sphere and its result; and
150	that which has the same sphere and the same result I call the same
150	faculty, but that which has another sphere and another result I call
150	different.  Would that be your way of speaking?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And will you be so very good as to answer one more question?  Would you
150	say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?
150	
150	Certainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all faculties.
150	
150	And is opinion also a faculty?
150	
150	Certainly, he said; for opinion is that with which we are able to form
150	an opinion.
150	
150	And yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not
150	the same as opinion?
150	
150	Why, yes, he said:  how can any reasonable being ever identify that
150	which is infallible with that which errs?
150	
150	An excellent answer, proving, I said, that we are quite conscious of a
150	distinction between them.
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct
150	spheres or subject-matters?
150	
150	That is certain.
150	
150	Being is the sphere or subject-matter of knowledge, and knowledge is to
150	know the nature of being?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And opinion is to have an opinion?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And do we know what we opine? or is the subject-matter of opinion the
150	same as the subject-matter of knowledge?
150	
150	Nay, he replied, that has been already disproven; if difference in
150	faculty implies difference in the sphere or subject matter, and if, as
150	we were saying, opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties, then the
150	sphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same.
150	
150	Then if being is the subject-matter of knowledge, something else must
150	be the subject-matter of opinion?
150	
150	Yes, something else.
150	
150	Well then, is not-being the subject-matter of opinion? or, rather, how
150	can there be an opinion at all about not-being? Reflect: when a man has
150	an opinion, has he not an opinion about something?  Can he have an
150	opinion which is an opinion about nothing?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	He who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, nothing?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Of not-being, ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative; of
150	being, knowledge?
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	Then opinion is not concerned either with being or with not-being?
150	
150	Not with either.
150	
150	And can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?
150	
150	That seems to be true.
150	
150	But is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in a
150	greater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than
150	ignorance?
150	
150	In neither.
150	
150	Then I suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge,
150	but lighter than ignorance?
150	
150	Both; and in no small degree.
150	
150	And also to be within and between them?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Then you would infer that opinion is intermediate?
150	
150	No question.
150	
150	But were we not saying before, that if anything appeared to be of a
150	sort which is and is not at the same time, that sort of thing would
150	appear also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute
150	not-being; and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor
150	ignorance, but will be found in the interval between them?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And in that interval there has now been discovered something which we
150	call opinion?
150	
150	There has.
150	
150	Then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally
150	of the nature of being and not-being, and cannot rightly be termed
150	either, pure and simple; this unknown term, when discovered, we may
150	truly call the subject of opinion, and assign each to its proper
150	faculty, the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to
150	the faculty of the mean.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	This being premised, I would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that
150	there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty--in whose opinion
150	the beautiful is the manifold--he, I say, your lover of beautiful
150	sights, who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one, and the
150	just is one, or that anything is one--to him I would appeal, saying,
150	Will you be so very kind, sir, as to tell us whether, of all these
150	beautiful things, there is one which will not be found ugly; or of the
150	just, which will not be found unjust; or of the holy, which will not
150	also be unholy?
150	
150	No, he replied; the beautiful will in some point of view be found ugly;
150	and the same is true of the rest.
150	
150	And may not the many which are doubles be also halves?--doubles, that
150	is, of one thing, and halves of another?
150	
150	Quite true.
150	
150	And things great and small, heavy and light, as they are termed, will
150	not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names?
150	
150	True; both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of
150	them.
150	
150	And can any one of those many things which are called by particular
150	names be said to be this rather than not to be this?
150	
150	He replied:  They are like the punning riddles which are asked at
150	feasts or the children's puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat,
150	with what he hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat
150	was sitting.  The individual objects of which I am speaking are also a
150	riddle, and have a double sense: nor can you fix them in your mind,
150	either as being or not-being, or both, or neither.
150	
150	Then what will you do with them?  I said.  Can they have a better place
150	than between being and not-being? For they are clearly not in greater
150	darkness or negation than not-being, or more full of light and
150	existence than being.
150	
150	That is quite true, he said.
150	
150	Thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the
150	multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are
150	tossing about in some region which is halfway between pure being and
150	pure not-being?
150	
150	We have.
150	
150	Yes; and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we might
150	find was to be described as matter of opinion, and not as matter of
150	knowledge; being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by
150	the intermediate faculty.
150	
150	Quite true.
150	
150	Then those who see the many beautiful, and who yet neither see absolute
150	beauty, nor can follow any guide who points the way thither; who see
150	the many just, and not absolute justice, and the like,--such persons
150	may be said to have opinion but not knowledge?
150	
150	That is certain.
150	
150	But those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to
150	know, and not to have opinion only?
150	
150	Neither can that be denied.
150	
150	The one loves and embraces the subjects of knowledge, the other those
150	of opinion?  The latter are the same, as I dare say will remember, who
150	listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours, but would not
150	tolerate the existence of absolute beauty.
150	
150	Yes, I remember.
150	
150	Shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of
150	opinion rather than lovers of wisdom, and will they be very angry with
150	us for thus describing them?
150	
150	I shall tell them not to be angry; no man should be angry at what is
150	true.
150	
150	But those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers of
150	wisdom and not lovers of opinion.
150	
150	Assuredly.
150	
150

150	
150	BOOK VI
150	
150	
150	SOCRATES - GLAUCON
150	
150	AND thus, Glaucon, after the argument has gone a weary way, the true
150	and the false philosophers have at length appeared in view.
150	
150	I do not think, he said, that the way could have been shortened.
150	
150	I suppose not, I said; and yet I believe that we might have had a
150	better view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined
150	to this one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting
150	us, which he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just
150	differs from that of the unjust must consider.
150	
150	And what is the next question? he asked.
150	
150	Surely, I said, the one which follows next in order.  Inasmuch as
150	philosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable, and
150	those who wander in the region of the many and variable are not
150	philosophers, I must ask you which of the two classes should be the
150	rulers of our State?
150	
150	And how can we rightly answer that question?
150	
150	Whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions
150	of our State--let them be our guardians.
150	
150	Very good.
150	
150	Neither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to
150	keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?
150	
150	There can be no question of that.
150	
150	And are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of
150	the true being of each thing, and who have in their souls no clear
150	pattern, and are unable as with a painter's eye to look at the absolute
150	truth and to that original to repair, and having perfect vision of the
150	other world to order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice in this,
150	if not already ordered, and to guard and preserve the order of
150	them--are not such persons, I ask, simply blind?
150	
150	Truly, he replied, they are much in that condition.
150	
150	And shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides
150	being their equals in experience and falling short of them in no
150	particular of virtue, also know the very truth of each thing?
150	
150	There can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this
150	greatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place
150	unless they fail in some other respect.
150	
150	Suppose then, I said, that we determine how far they can unite this and
150	the other excellences.
150	
150	By all means.
150	
150	In the first place, as we began by observing, the nature of the
150	philosopher has to be ascertained.  We must come to an understanding
150	about him, and, when we have done so, then, if I am not mistaken, we
150	shall also acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible, and
150	that those in whom they are united, and those only, should be rulers in
150	the State.
150	
150	What do you mean?
150	
150	Let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort
150	which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and
150	corruption.
150	
150	Agreed.
150	
150	And further, I said, let us agree that they are lovers of all true
150	being; there is no part whether greater or less, or more or less
150	honourable, which they are willing to renounce; as we said before of
150	the lover and the man of ambition.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And if they are to be what we were describing, is there not another
150	quality which they should also possess?
150	
150	What quality?
150	
150	Truthfulness:  they will never intentionally receive into their mind
150	falsehood, which is their detestation, and they will love the truth.
150	
150	Yes, that may be safely affirmed of them.
150	
150	'May be,' my friend, I replied, is not the word; say rather 'must be
150	affirmed:'  for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help
150	loving all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections.
150	
150	Right, he said.
150	
150	And is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth?
150	
150	How can there be?
150	
150	Can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood?
150	
150	Never.
150	
150	The true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far as
150	in him lies, desire all truth?
150	
150	Assuredly.
150	
150	But then again, as we know by experience, he whose desires are strong
150	in one direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like a
150	stream which has been drawn off into another channel.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	He whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be
150	absorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily
150	pleasure--I mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one.
150	
150	That is most certain.
150	
150	Such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous; for
150	the motives which make another man desirous of having and spending,
150	have no place in his character.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be considered.
150	
150	What is that?
150	
150	There should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can more
150	antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the
150	whole of things both divine and human.
150	
150	Most true, he replied.
150	
150	Then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of
150	all time and all existence, think much of human life?
150	
150	He cannot.
150	
150	Or can such an one account death fearful?
150	
150	No indeed.
150	
150	Then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Or again:  can he who is harmoniously constituted, who is not covetous
150	or mean, or a boaster, or a coward-can he, I say, ever be unjust or
150	hard in his dealings?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	Then you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle, or rude
150	and unsociable; these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the
150	philosophical nature from the unphilosophical.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	There is another point which should be remarked.
150	
150	What point?
150	
150	Whether he has or has not a pleasure in learning; for no one will love
150	that which gives him pain, and in which after much toil he makes little
150	progress.
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	And again, if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns,
150	will he not be an empty vessel?
150	
150	That is certain.
150	
150	Labouring in vain, he must end in hating himself and his fruitless
150	occupation?  Yes.
150	
150	Then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic
150	natures; we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And once more, the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to
150	disproportion?
150	
150	Undoubtedly.
150	
150	And do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion?
150	
150	To proportion.
150	
150	Then, besides other qualities, we must try to find a naturally
150	well-proportioned and gracious mind, which will move spontaneously
150	towards the true being of everything.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Well, and do not all these qualities, which we have been enumerating,
150	go together, and are they not, in a manner, necessary to a soul, which
150	is to have a full and perfect participation of being?
150	
150	They are absolutely necessary, he replied.
150	
150	And must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has
150	the gift of a good memory, and is quick to learn,--noble, gracious, the
150	friend of truth, justice, courage, temperance, who are his kindred?
150	
150	The god of jealousy himself, he said, could find no fault with such a
150	study.
150	
150	And to men like him, I said, when perfected by years and education, and
150	to these only you will entrust the State.
150	
150	SOCRATES - ADEIMANTUS
150	
150	Here Adeimantus interposed and said:  To these statements, Socrates, no
150	one can offer a reply; but when you talk in this way, a strange feeling
150	passes over the minds of your hearers:  They fancy that they are led
150	astray a little at each step in the argument, owing to their own want
150	of skill in asking and answering questions; these littles accumulate,
150	and at the end of the discussion they are found to have sustained a
150	mighty overthrow and all their former notions appear to be turned
150	upside down.  And as unskilful players of draughts are at last shut up
150	by their more skilful adversaries and have no piece to move, so they
150	too find themselves shut up at last; for they have nothing to say in
150	this new game of which words are the counters; and yet all the time
150	they are in the right.  The observation is suggested to me by what is
150	now occurring.  For any one of us might say, that although in words he
150	is not able to meet you at each step of the argument, he sees as a fact
150	that the votaries of philosophy, when they carry on the study, not only
150	in youth as a part of education, but as the pursuit of their maturer
150	years, most of them become strange monsters, not to say utter rogues,
150	and that those who may be considered the best of them are made useless
150	to the world by the very study which you extol.
150	
150	Well, and do you think that those who say so are wrong?
150	
150	I cannot tell, he replied; but I should like to know what is your
150	opinion.
150	
150	Hear my answer; I am of opinion that they are quite right.
150	
150	Then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from
150	evil until philosophers rule in them, when philosophers are
150	acknowledged by us to be of no use to them?
150	
150	You ask a question, I said, to which a reply can only be given in a
150	parable.
150	
150	Yes, Socrates; and that is a way of speaking to which you are not at
150	all accustomed, I suppose.
150	
150	I perceive, I said, that you are vastly amused at having plunged me
150	into such a hopeless discussion; but now hear the parable, and then you
150	will be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination: for the
150	manner in which the best men are treated in their own States is so
150	grievous that no single thing on earth is comparable to it; and
150	therefore, if I am to plead their cause, I must have recourse to
150	fiction, and put together a figure made up of many things, like the
150	fabulous unions of goats and stags which are found in pictures.
150	Imagine then a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is
150	taller and stronger than any of the crew, but he is a little deaf and
150	has a similar infirmity in sight, and his knowledge of navigation is
150	not much better.  The sailors are quarrelling with one another about
150	the steering--every one is of opinion that he has a right to steer,
150	though he has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell who
150	taught him or when he learned, and will further assert that it cannot
150	be taught, and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who says the
150	contrary.  They throng about the captain, begging and praying him to
150	commit the helm to them; and if at any time they do not prevail, but
150	others are preferred to them, they kill the others or throw them
150	overboard, and having first chained up the noble captain's senses with
150	drink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take possession of the
150	ship and make free with the stores; thus, eating and drinking, they
150	proceed on their voyage in such a manner as might be expected of them.
150	Him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot for
150	getting the ship out of the captain's hands into their own whether by
150	force or persuasion, they compliment with the name of sailor, pilot,
150	able seaman, and abuse the other sort of man, whom they call a
150	good-for-nothing; but that the true pilot must pay attention to the
150	year and seasons and sky and stars and winds, and whatever else belongs
150	to his art, if he intends to be really qualified for the command of a
150	ship, and that he must and will be the steerer, whether other people
150	like or not-the possibility of this union of authority with the
150	steerer's art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been
150	made part of their calling.  Now in vessels which are in a state of
150	mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be
150	regarded?  Will he not be called by them a prater, a star-gazer, a
150	good-for-nothing?
150	
150	Of course, said Adeimantus.
150	
150	Then you will hardly need, I said, to hear the interpretation of the
150	figure, which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the
150	State; for you understand already.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Then suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is
150	surprised at finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities;
150	explain it to him and try to convince him that their having honour
150	would be far more extraordinary.
150	
150	I will.
150	
150	Say to him, that, in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be
150	useless to the rest of the world, he is right; but also tell him to
150	attribute their uselessness to the fault of those who will not use
150	them, and not to themselves.  The pilot should not humbly beg the
150	sailors to be commanded by him--that is not the order of nature;
150	neither are 'the wise to go to the doors of the rich'--the ingenious
150	author of this saying told a lie--but the truth is, that, when a man is
150	ill, whether he be rich or poor, to the physician he must go, and he
150	who wants to be governed, to him who is able to govern.  The ruler who
150	is good for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled by him;
150	although the present governors of mankind are of a different stamp;
150	they may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors, and the true
150	helmsmen to those who are called by them good-for-nothings and
150	star-gazers.
150	
150	Precisely so, he said.
150	
150	For these reasons, and among men like these, philosophy, the noblest
150	pursuit of all, is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the
150	opposite faction; not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done
150	to her by her opponents, but by her own professing followers, the same
150	of whom you suppose the accuser to say, that the greater number of them
150	are arrant rogues, and the best are useless; in which opinion I agreed.
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And the reason why the good are useless has now been explained?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is
150	also unavoidable, and that this is not to be laid to the charge of
150	philosophy any more than the other?
150	
150	By all means.
150	
150	And let us ask and answer in turn, first going back to the description
150	of the gentle and noble nature.  Truth, as you will remember, was his
150	leader, whom he followed always and in all things; failing in this, he
150	was an impostor, and had no part or lot in true philosophy.
150	
150	Yes, that was said.
150	
150	Well, and is not this one quality, to mention no others, greatly at
150	variance with present notions of him?
150	
150	Certainly, he said.
150	
150	And have we not a right to say in his defence, that the true lover of
150	knowledge is always striving after being--that is his nature; he will
150	not rest in the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance
150	only, but will go on--the keen edge will not be blunted, nor the force
150	of his desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of the true
150	nature of every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power in the soul,
150	and by that power drawing near and mingling and becoming incorporate
150	with very being, having begotten mind and truth, he will have knowledge
150	and will live and grow truly, and then, and not till then, will he
150	cease from his travail.
150	
150	Nothing, he said, can be more just than such a description of him.
150	
150	And will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher's nature?  Will
150	he not utterly hate a lie?
150	
150	He will.
150	
150	And when truth is the captain, we cannot suspect any evil of the band
150	which he leads?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	Justice and health of mind will be of the company, and temperance will
150	follow after?
150	
150	True, he replied.
150	
150	Neither is there any reason why I should again set in array the
150	philosopher's virtues, as you will doubtless remember that courage,
150	magnificence, apprehension, memory, were his natural gifts.  And you
150	objected that, although no one could deny what I then said, still, if
150	you leave words and look at facts, the persons who are thus described
150	are some of them manifestly useless, and the greater number utterly
150	depraved; we were then led to enquire into the grounds of these
150	accusations, and have now arrived at the point of asking why are the
150	majority bad, which question of necessity brought us back to the
150	examination and definition of the true philosopher.
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	And we have next to consider the corruptions of the philosophic nature,
150	why so many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling--I am speaking of
150	those who were said to be useless but not wicked--and, when we have
150	done with them, we will speak of the imitators of philosophy, what
150	manner of men are they who aspire after a profession which is above
150	them and of which they are unworthy, and then, by their manifold
150	inconsistencies, bring upon philosophy, and upon all philosophers, that
150	universal reprobation of which we speak.
150	
150	What are these corruptions? he said.
150	
150	I will see if I can explain them to you.  Every one will admit that a
150	nature having in perfection all the qualities which we required in a
150	philosopher, is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men.
150	
150	Rare indeed.
150	
150	And what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare
150	natures!
150	
150	What causes?
150	
150	In the first place there are their own virtues, their courage,
150	temperance, and the rest of them, every one of which praise worthy
150	qualities (and this is a most singular circumstance) destroys and
150	distracts from philosophy the soul which is the possessor of them.
150	
150	That is very singular, he replied.
150	
150	Then there are all the ordinary goods of life--beauty, wealth,
150	strength, rank, and great connections in the State--you understand the
150	sort of things--these also have a corrupting and distracting effect.
150	
150	I understand; but I should like to know more precisely what you mean
150	about them.
150	
150	Grasp the truth as a whole, I said, and in the right way; you will then
150	have no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks, and they will
150	no longer appear strange to you.
150	
150	And how am I to do so? he asked.
150	
150	Why, I said, we know that all germs or seeds, whether vegetable or
150	animal, when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or
150	soil, in proportion to their vigour, are all the more sensitive to the
150	want of a suitable environment, for evil is a greater enemy to what is
150	good than what is not.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	There is reason in supposing that the finest natures, when under alien
150	conditions, receive more injury than the inferior, because the contrast
150	is greater.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And may we not say, Adeimantus, that the most gifted minds, when they
150	are ill-educated, become pre-eminently bad?  Do not great crimes and
150	the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by
150	education rather than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are
150	scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil?
150	
150	There I think that you are right.
150	
150	And our philosopher follows the same analogy-he is like a plant which,
150	having proper nurture, must necessarily grow and mature into all
150	virtue, but, if sown and planted in an alien soil, becomes the most
150	noxious of all weeds, unless he be preserved by some divine power.  Do
150	you really think, as people so often say, that our youth are corrupted
150	by Sophists, or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any
150	degree worth speaking of?  Are not the public who say these things the
150	greatest of all Sophists?  And do they not educate to perfection young
150	and old, men and women alike, and fashion them after their own hearts?
150	
150	When is this accomplished? he said.
150	
150	When they meet together, and the world sits down at an assembly, or in
150	a court of law, or a theatre, or a camp, or in any other popular
150	resort, and there is a great uproar, and they praise some things which
150	are being said or done, and blame other things, equally exaggerating
150	both, shouting and clapping their hands, and the echo of the rocks and
150	the place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise
150	or blame--at such a time will not a young man's heart, as they say,
150	leap within him?  Will any private training enable him to stand firm
150	against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion? or will he be
150	carried away by the stream?  Will he not have the notions of good and
150	evil which the public in general have--he will do as they do, and as
150	they are, such will he be?
150	
150	Yes, Socrates; necessity will compel him.
150	
150	And yet, I said, there is a still greater necessity, which has not been
150	mentioned.
150	
150	What is that?
150	
150	The gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death which, as you
150	are aware, these new Sophists and educators who are the public, apply
150	when their words are powerless.
150	
150	Indeed they do; and in right good earnest.
150	
150	Now what opinion of any other Sophist, or of any private person, can be
150	expected to overcome in such an unequal contest?
150	
150	None, he replied.
150	
150	No, indeed, I said, even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly;
150	there neither is, nor has been, nor is ever likely to be, any different
150	type of character which has had no other training in virtue but that
150	which is supplied by public opinion--I speak, my friend, of human
150	virtue only; what is more than human, as the proverb says, is not
150	included:  for I would not have you ignorant that, in the present evil
150	state of governments, whatever is saved and comes to good is saved by
150	the power of God, as we may truly say.
150	
150	I quite assent, he replied.
150	
150	Then let me crave your assent also to a further observation.
150	
150	What are you going to say?
150	
150	Why, that all those mercenary individuals, whom the many call Sophists
150	and whom they deem to be their adversaries, do, in fact, teach nothing
150	but the opinion of the many, that is to say, the opinions of their
150	assemblies; and this is their wisdom.  I might compare them to a man
150	who should study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who
150	is fed by him-he would learn how to approach and handle him, also at
150	what times and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse, and
150	what is the meaning of his several cries, and by what sounds, when
150	another utters them, he is soothed or infuriated; and you may suppose
150	further, that when, by continually attending upon him, he has become
150	perfect in all this, he calls his knowledge wisdom, and makes of it a
150	system or art, which he proceeds to teach, although he has no real
150	notion of what he means by the principles or passions of which he is
150	speaking, but calls this honourable and that dishonourable, or good or
150	evil, or just or unjust, all in accordance with the tastes and tempers
150	of the great brute.  Good he pronounces to be that in which the beast
150	delights and evil to be that which he dislikes; and he can give no
150	other account of them except that the just and noble are the necessary,
150	having never himself seen, and having no power of explaining to others
150	the nature of either, or the difference between them, which is immense.
150	By heaven, would not such an one be a rare educator?
150	
150	Indeed, he would.
150	
150	And in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of
150	the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting or
150	music, or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom I have been
150	describing?  For when a man consorts with the many, and exhibits to
150	them his poem or other work of art or the service which he has done the
150	State, making them his judges when he is not obliged, the so-called
150	necessity of Diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they praise.
150	And yet the reasons are utterly ludicrous which they give in
150	confirmation of their own notions about the honourable and good.  Did
150	you ever hear any of them which were not?
150	
150	No, nor am I likely to hear.
150	
150	You recognise the truth of what I have been saying?  Then let me ask
150	you to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to
150	believe in the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many
150	beautiful, or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in
150	each kind?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	And therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of
150	the world?
150	
150	They must.
150	
150	And of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them?
150	
150	That is evident.
150	
150	Then, do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved in
150	his calling to the end? and remember what we were saying of him, that
150	he was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence--these
150	were admitted by us to be the true philosopher's gifts.
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Will not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first
150	among all, especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental ones?
150	
150	Certainly, he said.
150	
150	And his friends and fellow-citizens will want to use him as he gets
150	older for their own purposes?
150	
150	No question.
150	
150	Falling at his feet, they will make requests to him and do him honour
150	and flatter him, because they want to get into their hands now, the
150	power which he will one day possess.
150	
150	That often happens, he said.
150	
150	And what will a man such as he be likely to do under such
150	circumstances, especially if he be a citizen of a great city, rich and
150	noble, and a tall proper youth?  Will he not be full of boundless
150	aspirations, and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of Hellenes
150	and of barbarians, and having got such notions into his head will he
150	not dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and
150	senseless pride?
150	
150	To be sure he will.
150	
150	Now, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to him
150	and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which can
150	only be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse
150	circumstances, he will be easily induced to listen?
150	
150	Far otherwise.
150	
150	And even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural
150	reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and
150	taken captive by philosophy, how will his friends behave when they
150	think that they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping
150	to reap from his companionship?  Will they not do and say anything to
150	prevent him from yielding to his better nature and to render his
150	teacher powerless, using to this end private intrigues as well as
150	public prosecutions?
150	
150	There can be no doubt of it.
150	
150	And how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	Then were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which
150	make a man a philosopher may, if he be ill-educated, divert him from
150	philosophy, no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other
150	so-called goods of life?
150	
150	We were quite right.
150	
150	Thus, my excellent friend, is brought about all that ruin and failure
150	which I have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best of
150	all pursuits; they are natures which we maintain to be rare at any
150	time; this being the class out of which come the men who are the
150	authors of the greatest evil to States and individuals; and also of the
150	greatest good when the tide carries them in that direction; but a small
150	man never was the doer of any great thing either to individuals or to
150	States.
150	
150	That is most true, he said.
150	
150	And so philosophy is left desolate, with her marriage rite incomplete:
150	for her own have fallen away and forsaken her, and while they are
150	leading a false and unbecoming life, other unworthy persons, seeing
150	that she has no kinsmen to be her protectors, enter in and dishonour
150	her; and fasten upon her the reproaches which, as you say, her
150	reprovers utter, who affirm of her votaries that some are good for
150	nothing, and that the greater number deserve the severest punishment.
150	
150	That is certainly what people say.
150	
150	Yes; and what else would you expect, I said, when you think of the puny
150	creatures who, seeing this land open to them--a land well stocked with
150	fair names and showy titles--like prisoners running out of prison into
150	a sanctuary, take a leap out of their trades into philosophy; those who
150	do so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable crafts?
150	For, although philosophy be in this evil case, still there remains a
150	dignity about her which is not to be found in the arts.  And many are
150	thus attracted by her whose natures are imperfect and whose souls are
150	maimed and disfigured by their meannesses, as their bodies are by their
150	trades and crafts.  Is not this unavoidable?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Are they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out of
150	durance and come into a fortune; he takes a bath and puts on a new
150	coat, and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his master's
150	daughter, who is left poor and desolate?
150	
150	A most exact parallel.
150	
150	What will be the issue of such marriages?  Will they not be vile and
150	bastard?
150	
150	There can be no question of it.
150	
150	And when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and
150	make an alliance with her who is a rank above them what sort of ideas
150	and opinions are likely to be generated?  Will they not be sophisms
150	captivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy of or
150	akin to true wisdom?
150	
150	No doubt, he said.
150	
150	Then, Adeimantus, I said, the worthy disciples of philosophy will be
150	but a small remnant:  perchance some noble and well-educated person,
150	detained by exile in her service, who in the absence of corrupting
150	influences remains devoted to her; or some lofty soul born in a mean
150	city, the politics of which he contemns and neglects; and there may be
150	a gifted few who leave the arts, which they justly despise, and come to
150	her;--or peradventure there are some who are restrained by our friend
150	Theages' bridle; for everything in the life of Theages conspired to
150	divert him from philosophy; but ill-health kept him away from politics.
150	My own case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning, for
150	rarely, if ever, has such a monitor been given to any other man.  Those
150	who belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed a
150	possession philosophy is, and have also seen enough of the madness of
150	the multitude; and they know that no politician is honest, nor is there
150	any champion of justice at whose side they may fight and be saved.
150	Such an one may be compared to a man who has fallen among wild
150	beasts--he will not join in the wickedness of his fellows, but neither
150	is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures, and therefore
150	seeing that he would be of no use to the State or to his friends, and
150	reflecting that he would have to throw away his life without doing any
150	good either to himself or others, he holds his peace, and goes his own
150	way.  He is like one who, in the storm of dust and sleet which the
150	driving wind hurries along, retires under the shelter of a wall; and
150	seeing the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is content, if only
150	he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness, and
150	depart in peace and good-will, with bright hopes.
150	
150	Yes, he said, and he will have done a great work before he departs.
150	
150	A great work--yes; but not the greatest, unless he find a State
150	suitable to him; for in a State which is suitable to him, he will have
150	a larger growth and be the saviour of his country, as well as of
150	himself.
150	
150	The causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been
150	sufficiently explained:  the injustice of the charges against her has
150	been shown-is there anything more which you wish to say?
150	
150	Nothing more on that subject, he replied; but I should like to know
150	which of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one
150	adapted to her.
150	
150	Not any of them, I said; and that is precisely the accusation which I
150	bring against them--not one of them is worthy of the philosophic
150	nature, and hence that nature is warped and estranged;--as the exotic
150	seed which is sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized, and is wont
150	to be overpowered and to lose itself in the new soil, even so this
150	growth of philosophy, instead of persisting, degenerates and receives
150	another character.  But if philosophy ever finds in the State that
150	perfection which she herself is, then will be seen that she is in truth
150	divine, and that all other things, whether natures of men or
150	institutions, are but human;--and now, I know that you are going to
150	ask, what that State is.
150	
150	No, he said; there you are wrong, for I was going to ask another
150	question--whether it is the State of which we are the founders and
150	inventors, or some other?
150	
150	Yes, I replied, ours in most respects; but you may remember my saying
150	before, that some living authority would always be required in the
150	State having the same idea of the constitution which guided you when as
150	legislator you were laying down the laws.
150	
150	That was said, he replied.
150	
150	Yes, but not in a satisfactory manner; you frightened us by interposing
150	objections, which certainly showed that the discussion would be long
150	and difficult; and what still remains is the reverse of easy.
150	
150	What is there remaining?
150	
150	The question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not to be
150	the ruin of the State:  All great attempts are attended with risk;
150	'hard is the good,' as men say.
150	
150	Still, he said, let the point be cleared up, and the enquiry will then
150	be complete.
150	
150	I shall not be hindered, I said, by any want of will, but, if at all,
150	by a want of power:  my zeal you may see for yourselves; and please to
150	remark in what I am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly I
150	declare that States should pursue philosophy, not as they do now, but
150	in a different spirit.
150	
150	In what manner?
150	
150	At present, I said, the students of philosophy are quite young;
150	beginning when they are hardly past childhood, they devote only the
150	time saved from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits; and even
150	those of them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit,
150	when they come within sight of the great difficulty of the subject, I
150	mean dialectic, take themselves off.  In after life when invited by
150	some one else, they may, perhaps, go and hear a lecture, and about this
150	they make much ado, for philosophy is not considered by them to be
150	their proper business:  at last, when they grow old, in most cases they
150	are extinguished more truly than Heracleitus' sun, inasmuch as they
150	never light up again.
150	
150	But what ought to be their course?
150	
150	Just the opposite.  In childhood and youth their study, and what
150	philosophy they learn, should be suited to their tender years: during
150	this period while they are growing up towards manhood, the chief and
150	special care should be given to their bodies that they may have them to
150	use in the service of philosophy; as life advances and the intellect
150	begins to mature, let them increase the gymnastics of the soul; but
150	when the strength of our citizens fails and is past civil and military
150	duties, then let them range at will and engage in no serious labour, as
150	we intend them to live happily here, and to crown this life with a
150	similar happiness in another.
150	
150	How truly in earnest you are, Socrates! he said; I am sure of that; and
150	yet most of your hearers, if I am not mistaken, are likely to be still
150	more earnest in their opposition to you, and will never be convinced;
150	Thrasymachus least of all.
150	
150	Do not make a quarrel, I said, between Thrasymachus and me, who have
150	recently become friends, although, indeed, we were never enemies; for I
150	shall go on striving to the utmost until I either convert him and other
150	men, or do something which may profit them against the day when they
150	live again, and hold the like discourse in another state of existence.
150	
150	You are speaking of a time which is not very near.
150	
150	Rather, I replied, of a time which is as nothing in comparison with
150	eternity.  Nevertheless, I do not wonder that the many refuse to
150	believe; for they have never seen that of which we are now speaking
150	realised; they have seen only a conventional imitation of philosophy,
150	consisting of words artificially brought together, not like these of
150	ours having a natural unity.  But a human being who in word and work is
150	perfectly moulded, as far as he can be, into the proportion and
150	likeness of virtue--such a man ruling in a city which bears the same
150	image, they have never yet seen, neither one nor many of them--do you
150	think that they ever did?
150	
150	No indeed.
150	
150	No, my friend, and they have seldom, if ever, heard free and noble
150	sentiments; such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every
150	means in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge,
150	while they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy, of which the
150	end is opinion and strife, whether they meet with them in the courts of
150	law or in society.
150	
150	They are strangers, he said, to the words of which you speak.
150	
150	And this was what we foresaw, and this was the reason why truth forced
150	us to admit, not without fear and hesitation, that neither cities nor
150	States nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small
150	class of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are
150	providentially compelled, whether they will or not, to take care of the
150	State, and until a like necessity be laid on the State to obey them; or
150	until kings, or if not kings, the sons of kings or princes, are
150	divinely inspired with a true love of true philosophy.  That either or
150	both of these alternatives are impossible, I see no reason to affirm:
150	if they were so, we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and
150	visionaries.  Am I not right?
150	
150	Quite right.
150	
150	If then, in the countless ages of the past, or at the present hour in
150	some foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken, the perfected
150	philosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a
150	superior power to have the charge of the State, we are ready to assert
150	to the death, that this our constitution has been, and is--yea, and
150	will be whenever the Muse of Philosophy is queen.  There is no
150	impossibility in all this; that there is a difficulty, we acknowledge
150	ourselves.
150	
150	My opinion agrees with yours, he said.
150	
150	But do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude?
150	
150	I should imagine not, he replied.
150	
150	O my friend, I said, do not attack the multitude:  they will change
150	their minds, if, not in an aggressive spirit, but gently and with the
150	view of soothing them and removing their dislike of over-education, you
150	show them your philosophers as they really are and describe as you were
150	just now doing their character and profession, and then mankind will
150	see that he of whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed--if
150	they view him in this new light, they will surely change their notion
150	of him, and answer in another strain.  Who can be at enmity with one
150	who loves them, who that is himself gentle and free from envy will be
150	jealous of one in whom there is no jealousy?  Nay, let me answer for
150	you, that in a few this harsh temper may be found but not in the
150	majority of mankind.
150	
150	I quite agree with you, he said.
150	
150	And do you not also think, as I do, that the harsh feeling which the
150	many entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders, who
150	rush in uninvited, and are always abusing them, and finding fault with
150	them, who make persons instead of things the theme of their
150	conversation? and nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than
150	this.
150	
150	It is most unbecoming.
150	
150	For he, Adeimantus, whose mind is fixed upon true being, has surely no
150	time to look down upon the affairs of earth, or to be filled with
150	malice and envy, contending against men; his eye is ever directed
150	towards things fixed and immutable, which he sees neither injuring nor
150	injured by one another, but all in order moving according to reason;
150	these he imitates, and to these he will, as far as he can, conform
150	himself.  Can a man help imitating that with which he holds reverential
150	converse?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	And the philosopher holding converse with the divine order, becomes
150	orderly and divine, as far as the nature of man allows; but like every
150	one else, he will suffer from detraction.
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	And if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning, not only himself,
150	but human nature generally, whether in States or individuals, into that
150	which he beholds elsewhere, will he, think you, be an unskilful
150	artificer of justice, temperance, and every civil virtue?
150	
150	Anything but unskilful.
150	
150	And if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the
150	truth, will they be angry with philosophy?  Will they disbelieve us,
150	when we tell them that no State can be happy which is not designed by
150	artists who imitate the heavenly pattern?
150	
150	They will not be angry if they understand, he said.  But how will they
150	draw out the plan of which you are speaking?
150	
150	They will begin by taking the State and the manners of men, from which,
150	as from a tablet, they will rub out the picture, and leave a clean
150	surface.  This is no easy task.  But whether easy or not, herein will
150	lie the difference between them and every other legislator,--they will
150	have nothing to do either with individual or State, and will inscribe
150	no laws, until they have either found, or themselves made, a clean
150	surface.
150	
150	They will be very right, he said.
150	
150	Having effected this, they will proceed to trace an outline of the
150	constitution?
150	
150	No doubt.
150	
150	And when they are filling in the work, as I conceive, they will often
150	turn their eyes upwards and downwards:  I mean that they will first
150	look at absolute justice and beauty and temperance, and again at the
150	human copy; and will mingle and temper the various elements of life
150	into the image of a man; and thus they will conceive according to that
150	other image, which, when existing among men, Homer calls the form and
150	likeness of God.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	And one feature they will erase, and another they will put in, they
150	have made the ways of men, as far as possible, agreeable to the ways of
150	God?
150	
150	Indeed, he said, in no way could they make a fairer picture.
150	
150	And now, I said, are we beginning to persuade those whom you described
150	as rushing at us with might and main, that the painter of constitutions
150	is such an one as we are praising; at whom they were so very indignant
150	because to his hands we committed the State; and are they growing a
150	little calmer at what they have just heard?
150	
150	Much calmer, if there is any sense in them.
150	
150	Why, where can they still find any ground for objection?  Will they
150	doubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being?
150	
150	They would not be so unreasonable.
150	
150	Or that his nature, being such as we have delineated, is akin to the
150	highest good?
150	
150	Neither can they doubt this.
150	
150	But again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under
150	favourable circumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any
150	ever was?  Or will they prefer those whom we have rejected?
150	
150	Surely not.
150	
150	Then will they still be angry at our saying, that, until philosophers
150	bear rule, States and individuals will have no rest from evil, nor will
150	this our imaginary State ever be realised?
150	
150	I think that they will be less angry.
150	
150	Shall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle, and
150	that they have been converted and for very shame, if for no other
150	reason, cannot refuse to come to terms?
150	
150	By all means, he said.
150	
150	Then let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected.  Will
150	any one deny the other point, that there may be sons of kings or
150	princes who are by nature philosophers?
150	
150	Surely no man, he said.
150	
150	And when they have come into being will any one say that they must of
150	necessity be destroyed; that they can hardly be saved is not denied
150	even by us; but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them
150	can escape--who will venture to affirm this?
150	
150	Who indeed!
150	
150	But, said I, one is enough; let there be one man who has a city
150	obedient to his will, and he might bring into existence the ideal
150	polity about which the world is so incredulous.
150	
150	Yes, one is enough.
150	
150	The ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been
150	describing, and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And that others should approve of what we approve, is no miracle or
150	impossibility?
150	
150	I think not.
150	
150	But we have sufficiently shown, in what has preceded, that all this, if
150	only possible, is assuredly for the best.
150	
150	We have.
150	
150	And now we say not only that our laws, if they could be enacted, would
150	be for the best, but also that the enactment of them, though difficult,
150	is not impossible.
150	
150	Very good.
150	
150	And so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject, but
150	more remains to be discussed;--how and by what studies and pursuits
150	will the saviours of the constitution be created, and at what ages are
150	they to apply themselves to their several studies?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	I omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women, and the
150	procreation of children, and the appointment of the rulers, because I
150	knew that the perfect State would be eyed with jealousy and was
150	difficult of attainment; but that piece of cleverness was not of much
150	service to me, for I had to discuss them all the same.  The women and
150	children are now disposed of, but the other question of the rulers must
150	be investigated from the very beginning.  We were saying, as you will
150	remember, that they were to be lovers of their country, tried by the
150	test of pleasures and pains, and neither in hardships, nor in dangers,
150	nor at any other critical moment were to lose their patriotism--he was
150	to be rejected who failed, but he who always came forth pure, like gold
150	tried in the refiner's fire, was to be made a ruler, and to receive
150	honours and rewards in life and after death.  This was the sort of
150	thing which was being said, and then the argument turned aside and
150	veiled her face; not liking to stir the question which has now arisen.
150	
150	I perfectly remember, he said.
150	
150	Yes, my friend, I said, and I then shrank from hazarding the bold word;
150	but now let me dare to say--that the perfect guardian must be a
150	philosopher.
150	
150	Yes, he said, let that be affirmed.
150	
150	And do not suppose that there will be many of them; for the gifts which
150	were deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together; they are mostly
150	found in shreds and patches.
150	
150	What do you mean? he said.
150	
150	You are aware, I replied, that quick intelligence, memory, sagacity,
150	cleverness, and similar qualities, do not often grow together, and that
150	persons who possess them and are at the same time high-spirited and
150	magnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in
150	a peaceful and settled manner; they are driven any way by their
150	impulses, and all solid principle goes out of them.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	On the other hand, those steadfast natures which can better be depended
150	upon, which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable, are
150	equally immovable when there is anything to be learned; they are always
150	in a torpid state, and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any
150	intellectual toil.
150	
150	Quite true.
150	
150	And yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those to
150	whom the higher education is to be imparted, and who are to share in
150	any office or command.
150	
150	Certainly, he said.
150	
150	And will they be a class which is rarely found?
150	
150	Yes, indeed.
150	
150	Then the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers
150	and pleasures which we mentioned before, but there is another kind of
150	probation which we did not mention--he must be exercised also in many
150	kinds of knowledge, to see whether the soul will be able to endure the
150	highest of all, will faint under them, as in any other studies and
150	exercises.
150	
150	Yes, he said, you are quite right in testing him.  But what do you mean
150	by the highest of all knowledge?
150	
150	You may remember, I said, that we divided the soul into three parts;
150	and distinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage,
150	and wisdom?
150	
150	Indeed, he said, if I had forgotten, I should not deserve to hear more.
150	
150	And do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion
150	of them?
150	
150	To what do you refer?
150	
150	We were saying, if I am not mistaken, that he who wanted to see them in
150	their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way, at the
150	end of which they would appear; but that we could add on a popular
150	exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded.
150	And you replied that such an exposition would be enough for you, and so
150	the enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate
150	manner; whether you were satisfied or not, it is for you to say.
150	
150	Yes, he said, I thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair
150	measure of truth.
150	
150	But, my friend, I said, a measure of such things Which in any degree
150	falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure; for nothing
150	imperfect is the measure of anything, although persons are too apt to
150	be contented and think that they need search no further.
150	
150	Not an uncommon case when people are indolent.
150	
150	Yes, I said; and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the
150	State and of the laws.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	The guardian then, I said, must be required to take the longer circuit,
150	and toll at learning as well as at gymnastics, or he will never reach
150	the highest knowledge of all which, as we were just now saying, is his
150	proper calling.
150	
150	What, he said, is there a knowledge still higher than this--higher than
150	justice and the other virtues?
150	
150	Yes, I said, there is.  And of the virtues too we must behold not the
150	outline merely, as at present--nothing short of the most finished
150	picture should satisfy us.  When little things are elaborated with an
150	infinity of pains, in order that they may appear in their full beauty
150	and utmost clearness, how ridiculous that we should not think the
150	highest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy!
150	
150	A right noble thought; but do you suppose that we shall refrain from
150	asking you what is this highest knowledge?
150	
150	Nay, I said, ask if you will; but I am certain that you have heard the
150	answer many times, and now you either do not understand me or, as I
150	rather think, you are disposed to be troublesome; for you have of been
150	told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge, and that all other
150	things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this.  You
150	can hardly be ignorant that of this I was about to speak, concerning
150	which, as you have often heard me say, we know so little; and, without
150	which, any other knowledge or possession of any kind will profit us
150	nothing.  Do you think that the possession of all other things is of
150	any value if we do not possess the good? or the knowledge of all other
150	things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?
150	
150	Assuredly not.
150	
150	You are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good,
150	but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by
150	knowledge, but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good?
150	
150	How ridiculous!
150	
150	Yes, I said, that they should begin by reproaching us with our
150	ignorance of the good, and then presume our knowledge of it--for the
150	good they define to be knowledge of the good, just as if we understood
150	them when they use the term 'good'--this is of course ridiculous.
150	
150	Most true, he said.
150	
150	And those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity; for
150	they are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as
150	good.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	There can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this
150	question is involved.
150	
150	There can be none.
150	
150	Further, do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to
150	seem to be what is just and honourable without the reality; but no one
150	is satisfied with the appearance of good--the reality is what they
150	seek; in the case of the good, appearance is despised by every one.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	Of this then, which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of all
150	his actions, having a presentiment that there is such an end, and yet
150	hesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same
150	assurance of this as of other things, and therefore losing whatever
150	good there is in other things,--of a principle such and so great as
150	this ought the best men in our State, to whom everything is entrusted,
150	to be in the darkness of ignorance?
150	
150	Certainly not, he said.
150	
150	I am sure, I said, that he who does not know now the beautiful and the
150	just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them; and I
150	suspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true
150	knowledge of them.
150	
150	That, he said, is a shrewd suspicion of yours.
150	
150	And if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our State will be
150	perfectly ordered?
150	
150	Of course, he replied; but I wish that you would tell me whether you
150	conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or
150	pleasure, or different from either.
150	
150	Aye, I said, I knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you
150	would not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these
150	matters.
150	
150	True, Socrates; but I must say that one who like you has passed a
150	lifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the
150	opinions of others, and never telling his own.
150	
150	Well, but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know?
150	
150	Not, he said, with the assurance of positive certainty; he has no right
150	to do that:  but he may say what he thinks, as a matter of opinion.
150	
150	And do you not know, I said, that all mere opinions are bad, and the
150	best of them blind?  You would not deny that those who have any true
150	notion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way
150	along the road?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base, when
150	others will tell you of brightness and beauty?
150	
150	GLAUCON - SOCRATES
150	
150	Still, I must implore you, Socrates, said Glaucon, not to turn away
150	just as you are reaching the goal; if you will only give such an
150	explanation of the good as you have already given of justice and
150	temperance and the other virtues, we shall be satisfied.
150	
150	Yes, my friend, and I shall be at least equally satisfied, but I cannot
150	help fearing that I shall fall, and that my indiscreet zeal will bring
150	ridicule upon me.  No, sweet sirs, let us not at present ask what is
150	the actual nature of the good, for to reach what is now in my thoughts
150	would be an effort too great for me.  But of the child of the good who
150	is likest him, I would fain speak, if I could be sure that you wished
150	to hear--otherwise, not.
150	
150	By all means, he said, tell us about the child, and you shall remain in
150	our debt for the account of the parent.
150	
150	I do indeed wish, I replied, that I could pay, and you receive, the
150	account of the parent, and not, as now, of the offspring only; take,
150	however, this latter by way of interest, and at the same time have a
150	care that i do not render a false account, although I have no intention
150	of deceiving you.
150	
150	Yes, we will take all the care that we can:  proceed.
150	
150	Yes, I said, but I must first come to an understanding with you, and
150	remind you of what I have mentioned in the course of this discussion,
150	and at many other times.
150	
150	What?
150	
150	The old story, that there is a many beautiful and a many good, and so
150	of other things which we describe and define; to all of them 'many' is
150	applied.
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	And there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good, and of other
150	things to which the term 'many' is applied there is an absolute; for
150	they may be brought under a single idea, which is called the essence of
150	each.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	The many, as we say, are seen but not known, and the ideas are known
150	but not seen.
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	And what is the organ with which we see the visible things?
150	
150	The sight, he said.
150	
150	And with the hearing, I said, we hear, and with the other senses
150	perceive the other objects of sense?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	But have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex
150	piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived?
150	
150	No, I never have, he said.
150	
150	Then reflect; has the ear or voice need of any third or additional
150	nature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be
150	heard?
150	
150	Nothing of the sort.
150	
150	No, indeed, I replied; and the same is true of most, if not all, the
150	other senses--you would not say that any of them requires such an
150	addition?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	But you see that without the addition of some other nature there is no
150	seeing or being seen?
150	
150	How do you mean?
150	
150	Sight being, as I conceive, in the eyes, and he who has eyes wanting to
150	see; colour being also present in them, still unless there be a third
150	nature specially adapted to the purpose, the owner of the eyes will see
150	nothing and the colours will be invisible.
150	
150	Of what nature are you speaking?
150	
150	Of that which you term light, I replied.
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	Noble, then, is the bond which links together sight and visibility, and
150	great beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature; for light is
150	their bond, and light is no ignoble thing?
150	
150	Nay, he said, the reverse of ignoble.
150	
150	And which, I said, of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord of
150	this element?  Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly
150	and the visible to appear?
150	
150	You mean the sun, as you and all mankind say.
150	
150	May not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows?
150	
150	How?
150	
150	Neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun?
150	
150	No.
150	
150	Yet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun?
150	
150	By far the most like.
150	
150	And the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is
150	dispensed from the sun?
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	Then the sun is not sight, but the author of sight who is recognised by
150	sight.
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	And this is he whom I call the child of the good, whom the good begat
150	in his own likeness, to be in the visible world, in relation to sight
150	and the things of sight, what the good is in the intellectual world in
150	relation to mind and the things of mind.
150	
150	Will you be a little more explicit? he said.
150	
150	Why, you know, I said, that the eyes, when a person directs them
150	towards objects on which the light of day is no longer shining, but the
150	moon and stars only, see dimly, and are nearly blind; they seem to have
150	no clearness of vision in them?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	But when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines,
150	they see clearly and there is sight in them?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And the soul is like the eye:  when resting upon that on which truth
150	and being shine, the soul perceives and understands and is radiant with
150	intelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and
150	perishing, then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about, and is
150	first of one opinion and then of another, and seems to have no
150	intelligence?
150	
150	Just so.
150	
150	Now, that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing to
150	the knower is what I would have you term the idea of good, and this you
150	will deem to be the cause of science, and of truth in so far as the
150	latter becomes the subject of knowledge; beautiful too, as are both
150	truth and knowledge, you will be right in esteeming this other nature
150	as more beautiful than either; and, as in the previous instance, light
150	and sight may be truly said to be like the sun, and yet not to be the
150	sun, so in this other sphere, science and truth may be deemed to be
150	like the good, but not the good; the good has a place of honour yet
150	higher.
150	
150	What a wonder of beauty that must be, he said, which is the author of
150	science and truth, and yet surpasses them in beauty; for you surely
150	cannot mean to say that pleasure is the good?
150	
150	God forbid, I replied; but may I ask you to consider the image in
150	another point of view?
150	
150	In what point of view?
150	
150	You would say, would you not, that the sun is only the author of
150	visibility in all visible things, but of generation and nourishment and
150	growth, though he himself is not generation?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	In like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of
150	knowledge to all things known, but of their being and essence, and yet
150	the good is not essence, but far exceeds essence in dignity and power.
150	
150	Glaucon said, with a ludicrous earnestness:  By the light of heaven,
150	how amazing!
150	
150	Yes, I said, and the exaggeration may be set down to you; for you made
150	me utter my fancies.
150	
150	And pray continue to utter them; at any rate let us hear if there is
150	anything more to be said about the similitude of the sun.
150	
150	Yes, I said, there is a great deal more.
150	
150	Then omit nothing, however slight.
150	
150	I will do my best, I said; but I should think that a great deal will
150	have to be omitted.
150	
150	You have to imagine, then, that there are two ruling powers, and that
150	one of them is set over the intellectual world, the other over the
150	visible.  I do not say heaven, lest you should fancy that I am playing
150	upon the name ('ourhanoz, orhatoz'). May I suppose that you have this
150	distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?
150	
150	I have.
150	
150	Now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts, and divide
150	each of them again in the same proportion, and suppose the two main
150	divisions to answer, one to the visible and the other to the
150	intelligible, and then compare the subdivisions in respect of their
150	clearness and want of clearness, and you will find that the first
150	section in the sphere of the visible consists of images.  And by images
150	I mean, in the first place, shadows, and in the second place,
150	reflections in water and in solid, smooth and polished bodies and the
150	like:  Do you understand?
150	
150	Yes, I understand.
150	
150	Imagine, now, the other section, of which this is only the resemblance,
150	to include the animals which we see, and everything that grows or is
150	made.
150	
150	Very good.
150	
150	Would you not admit that both the sections of this division have
150	different degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the
150	sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge?
150	
150	Most undoubtedly.
150	
150	Next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the
150	intellectual is to be divided.
150	
150	In what manner?
150	
150	Thus:--There are two subdivisions, in the lower or which the soul uses
150	the figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can
150	only be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle
150	descends to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes
150	out of hypotheses, and goes up to a principle which is above
150	hypotheses, making no use of images as in the former case, but
150	proceeding only in and through the ideas themselves.
150	
150	I do not quite understand your meaning, he said.
150	
150	Then I will try again; you will understand me better when I have made
150	some preliminary remarks.  You are aware that students of geometry,
150	arithmetic, and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and
150	the figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several
150	branches of science; these are their hypotheses, which they and
150	everybody are supposed to know, and therefore they do not deign to give
150	any account of them either to themselves or others; but they begin with
150	them, and go on until they arrive at last, and in a consistent manner,
150	at their conclusion?
150	
150	Yes, he said, I know.
150	
150	And do you not know also that although they make use of the visible
150	forms and reason about them, they are thinking not of these, but of the
150	ideals which they resemble; not of the figures which they draw, but of
150	the absolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on--the forms
150	which they draw or make, and which have shadows and reflections in
150	water of their own, are converted by them into images, but they are
150	really seeking to behold the things themselves, which can only be seen
150	with the eye of the mind?
150	
150	That is true.
150	
150	And of this kind I spoke as the intelligible, although in the search
150	after it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses; not ascending to a
150	first principle, because she is unable to rise above the region of
150	hypothesis, but employing the objects of which the shadows below are
150	resemblances in their turn as images, they having in relation to the
150	shadows and reflections of them a greater distinctness, and therefore a
150	higher value.
150	
150	I understand, he said, that you are speaking of the province of
150	geometry and the sister arts.
150	
150	And when I speak of the other division of the intelligible, you will
150	understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason
150	herself attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as
150	first principles, but only as hypotheses--that is to say, as steps and
150	points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in order
150	that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole; and
150	clinging to this and then to that which depends on this, by successive
150	steps she descends again without the aid of any sensible object, from
150	ideas, through ideas, and in ideas she ends.
150	
150	I understand you, he replied; not perfectly, for you seem to me to be
150	describing a task which is really tremendous; but, at any rate, I
150	understand you to say that knowledge and being, which the science of
150	dialectic contemplates, are clearer than the notions of the arts, as
150	they are termed, which proceed from hypotheses only: these are also
150	contemplated by the understanding, and not by the senses:  yet, because
150	they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle, those who
150	contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason upon
150	them, although when a first principle is added to them they are
150	cognizable by the higher reason.  And the habit which is concerned with
150	geometry and the cognate sciences I suppose that you would term
150	understanding and not reason, as being intermediate between opinion and
150	reason.
150	
150	You have quite conceived my meaning, I said; and now, corresponding to
150	these four divisions, let there be four faculties in the soul-reason
150	answering to the highest, understanding to the second, faith (or
150	conviction) to the third, and perception of shadows to the last-and let
150	there be a scale of them, and let us suppose that the several faculties
150	have clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth.
150	
150	I understand, he replied, and give my assent, and accept your
150	arrangement.
150

150	
150	BOOK VII
150	
150	
150	SOCRATES - GLAUCON
150	
150	AND now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is
150	enlightened or unenlightened:--Behold! human beings living in a
150	underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching
150	all along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have
150	their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see
150	before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their
150	heads.  Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and
150	between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will
150	see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which
150	marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the
150	puppets.
150	
150	I see.
150	
150	And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all sorts
150	of vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone
150	and various materials, which appear over the wall?  Some of them are
150	talking, others silent.
150	
150	You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners.
150	
150	Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the
150	shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of
150	the cave?
150	
150	True, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they were
150	never allowed to move their heads?
150	
150	And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would
150	only see the shadows?
150	
150	Yes, he said.
150	
150	And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not
150	suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the
150	other side, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by
150	spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?
150	
150	No question, he replied.
150	
150	To them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows
150	of the images.
150	
150	That is certain.
150	
150	And now look again, and see what will naturally follow it' the
150	prisoners are released and disabused of their error.  At first, when
150	any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn
150	his neck round and walk and look towards the light, he will suffer
150	sharp pains; the glare will distress him, and he will be unable to see
150	the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows; and
150	then conceive some one saying to him, that what he saw before was an
150	illusion, but that now, when he is approaching nearer to being and his
150	eye is turned towards more real existence, he has a clearer vision,
150	what will be his reply?  And you may further imagine that his
150	instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to
150	name them,--will he not be perplexed?  Will he not fancy that the
150	shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now
150	shown to him?
150	
150	Far truer.
150	
150	And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have
150	a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take and take in
150	the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to
150	be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?
150	
150	True, he now
150	
150	And suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and
150	rugged ascent, and held fast until he's forced into the presence of the
150	sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated?  When he
150	approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able
150	to see anything at all of what are now called realities.
150	
150	Not all in a moment, he said.
150	
150	He will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world.
150	And first he will see the shadows best, next the reflections of men and
150	other objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then he
150	will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled
150	heaven; and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the
150	sun or the light of the sun by day?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Last of he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of him
150	in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and not in
150	another; and he will contemplate him as he is.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	He will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and
150	the years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, and
150	in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have
150	been accustomed to behold?
150	
150	Clearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about him.
150	
150	And when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the den
150	and his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate
150	himself on the change, and pity them?
150	
150	Certainly, he would.
150	
150	And if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on
150	those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark
150	which of them went before, and which followed after, and which were
150	together; and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to
150	the future, do you think that he would care for such honours and
150	glories, or envy the possessors of them?  Would he not say with Homer,
150	
150	    Better to be the poor servant of a poor master,
150	
150	and to endure anything, rather than think as they do and live after
150	their manner?
150	
150	Yes, he said, I think that he would rather suffer anything than
150	entertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner.
150	
150	Imagine once more, I said, such an one coming suddenly out of the sun
150	to be replaced in his old situation; would he not be certain to have
150	his eyes full of darkness?
150	
150	To be sure, he said.
150	
150	And if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the
150	shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while
150	his sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and
150	the time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might
150	be very considerable) would he not be ridiculous?  Men would say of him
150	that up he went and down he came without his eyes; and that it was
150	better not even to think of ascending; and if any one tried to loose
150	another and lead him up to the light, let them only catch the offender,
150	and they would put him to death.
150	
150	No question, he said.
150	
150	This entire allegory, I said, you may now append, dear Glaucon, to the
150	previous argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the light of
150	the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret
150	the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual
150	world according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, I have
150	expressed whether rightly or wrongly God knows.  But, whether true or
150	false, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good
150	appears last of all, and is seen only with an effort; and, when seen,
150	is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and
150	right, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world,
150	and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and
150	that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally, either
150	in public or private life must have his eye fixed.
150	
150	I agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand you.
150	
150	Moreover, I said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this
150	beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their
150	souls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to
150	dwell; which desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be
150	trusted.
150	
150	Yes, very natural.
150	
150	And is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine
150	contemplations to the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a
150	ridiculous manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has
150	become accustomed to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight
150	in courts of law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows
150	of images of justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of
150	those who have never yet seen absolute justice?
150	
150	Anything but surprising, he replied.
150	
150	Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of
150	the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from
150	coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of
150	the mind's eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who
150	remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak,
150	will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of
150	man has come out of the brighter light, and is unable to see because
150	unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to the day is
150	dazzled by excess of light.  And he will count the one happy in his
150	condition and state of being, and he will pity the other; or, if he
150	have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light,
150	there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him
150	who returns from above out of the light into the den.
150	
150	That, he said, is a very just distinction.
150	
150	But then, if I am right, certain professors of education must be wrong
150	when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not
150	there before, like sight into blind eyes.
150	
150	They undoubtedly say this, he replied.
150	
150	Whereas, our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning
150	exists in the soul already; and that just as the eye was unable to turn
150	from darkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument of
150	knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the
150	world of becoming into that of being, and learn by degrees to endure
150	the sight of being, and of the brightest and best of being, or in other
150	words, of the good.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the
150	easiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight, for
150	that exists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is
150	looking away from the truth?
150	
150	Yes, he said, such an art may be presumed.
150	
150	And whereas the other so-called virtues of the soul seem to be akin to
150	bodily qualities, for even when they are not originally innate they can
150	be implanted later by habit and exercise, the of wisdom more than
150	anything else contains a divine element which always remains, and by
150	this conversion is rendered useful and profitable; or, on the other
150	hand, hurtful and useless.  Did you never observe the narrow
150	intelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue--how eager he
150	is, how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end; he is the
150	reverse of blind, but his keen eyesight is forced into the service of
150	evil, and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	But what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days
150	of their youth; and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures,
150	such as eating and drinking, which, like leaden weights, were attached
150	to them at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision of
150	their souls upon the things that are below--if, I say, they had been
150	released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction,
150	the very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as
150	they see what their eyes are turned to now.
150	
150	Very likely.
150	
150	Yes, I said; and there is another thing which is likely, or rather a
150	necessary inference from what has preceded, that neither the uneducated
150	and uninformed of the truth, nor yet those who never make an end of
150	their education, will be able ministers of State; not the former,
150	because they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their
150	actions, private as well as public; nor the latter, because they will
150	not act at all except upon compulsion, fancying that they are already
150	dwelling apart in the islands of the blest.
150	
150	Very true, he replied.
150	
150	Then, I said, the business of us who are the founders of the State will
150	be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have
150	already shown to be the greatest of all-they must continue to ascend
150	until they arrive at the good; but when they have ascended and seen
150	enough we must not allow them to do as they do now.
150	
150	What do you mean?
150	
150	I mean that they remain in the upper world:  but this must not be
150	allowed; they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the
150	den, and partake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth
150	having or not.
150	
150	But is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give them a worse life,
150	when they might have a better?
150	
150	You have again forgotten, my friend, I said, the intention of the
150	legislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy
150	above the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he held
150	the citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them
150	benefactors of the State, and therefore benefactors of one another; to
150	this end he created them, not to please themselves, but to be his
150	instruments in binding up the State.
150	
150	True, he said, I had forgotten.
150	
150	Observe, Glaucon, that there will be no injustice in compelling our
150	philosophers to have a care and providence of others; we shall explain
150	to them that in other States, men of their class are not obliged to
150	share in the toils of politics:  and this is reasonable, for they grow
150	up at their own sweet will, and the government would rather not have
150	them.  Being self-taught, they cannot be expected to show any gratitude
150	for a culture which they have never received.  But we have brought you
150	into the world to be rulers of the hive, kings of yourselves and of the
150	other citizens, and have educated you far better and more perfectly
150	than they have been educated, and you are better able to share in the
150	double duty.  Wherefore each of you, when his turn comes, must go down
150	to the general underground abode, and get the habit of seeing in the
150	dark.  When you have acquired the habit, you will see ten thousand
150	times better than the inhabitants of the den, and you will know what
150	the several images are, and what they represent, because you have seen
150	the beautiful and just and good in their truth.  And thus our State
150	which is also yours will be a reality, and not a dream only, and will
150	be administered in a spirit unlike that of other States, in which men
150	fight with one another about shadows only and are distracted in the
150	struggle for power, which in their eyes is a great good.  Whereas the
150	truth is that the State in which the rulers are most reluctant to
150	govern is always the best and most quietly governed, and the State in
150	which they are most eager, the worst.
150	
150	Quite true, he replied.
150	
150	And will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn at
150	the toils of State, when they are allowed to spend the greater part of
150	their time with one another in the heavenly light?
150	
150	Impossible, he answered; for they are just men, and the commands which
150	we impose upon them are just; there can be no doubt that every one of
150	them will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion
150	of our present rulers of State.
150	
150	Yes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point.  You must contrive
150	for your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler,
150	and then you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State which
150	offers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver and gold,
150	but in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life.
150	Whereas if they go to the administration of public affairs, poor and
150	hungering after the' own private advantage, thinking that hence they
150	are to snatch the chief good, order there can never be; for they will
150	be fighting about office, and the civil and domestic broils which thus
150	arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole State.
150	
150	Most true, he replied.
150	
150	And the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition
150	is that of true philosophy.  Do you know of any other?
150	
150	Indeed, I do not, he said.
150	
150	And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task?  For, if they
150	are, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.
150	
150	No question.
150	
150	Who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians?  Surely they
150	will be the men who are wisest about affairs of State, and by whom the
150	State is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours
150	and another and a better life than that of politics?
150	
150	They are the men, and I will choose them, he replied.
150	
150	And now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced,
150	and how they are to be brought from darkness to light,--as some are
150	said to have ascended from the world below to the gods?
150	
150	By all means, he replied.
150	
150	The process, I said, is not the turning over of an oyster-shell, but
150	the turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better
150	than night to the true day of being, that is, the ascent from below,
150	which we affirm to be true philosophy?
150	
150	Quite so.
150	
150	And should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of
150	effecting such a change?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	What sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming
150	to being?  And another consideration has just occurred to me: You will
150	remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes
150	
150	Yes, that was said.
150	
150	Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?
150	
150	What quality?
150	
150	Usefulness in war.
150	
150	Yes, if possible.
150	
150	There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?
150	
150	Just so.
150	
150	There was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the
150	body, and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and
150	corruption?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?  No.
150	
150	But what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent
150	into our former scheme?
150	
150	Music, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic,
150	and trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony making
150	them harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them science; and
150	the words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements of
150	rhythm and harmony in them.  But in music there was nothing which
150	tended to that good which you are now seeking.
150	
150	You are most accurate, I said, in your recollection; in music there
150	certainly was nothing of the kind.  But what branch of knowledge is
150	there, my dear Glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since all the
150	useful arts were reckoned mean by us?
150	
150	Undoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the arts
150	are also excluded, what remains?
150	
150	Well, I said, there may be nothing left of our special subjects; and
150	then we shall have to take something which is not special, but of
150	universal application.
150	
150	What may that be?
150	
150	A something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in
150	common, and which every one first has to learn among the elements of
150	education.
150	
150	What is that?
150	
150	The little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three--in a word,
150	number and calculation:--do not all arts and sciences necessarily
150	partake of them?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Then the art of war partakes of them?
150	
150	To the sure.
150	
150	Then Palamedes, whenever he appears in tragedy, proves Agamemnon
150	ridiculously unfit to be a general.  Did you never remark how he
150	declares that he had invented number, and had numbered the ships and
150	set in array the ranks of the army at Troy; which implies that they had
150	never been numbered before, and Agamemnon must be supposed literally to
150	have been incapable of counting his own feet--how could he if he was
150	ignorant of number?  And if that is true, what sort of general must he
150	have been?
150	
150	I should say a very strange one, if this was as you say.
150	
150	Can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic?
150	
150	Certainly he should, if he is to have the smallest understanding of
150	military tactics, or indeed, I should rather say, if he is to be a man
150	at all.
150	
150	I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have of
150	this study?
150	
150	What is your notion?
150	
150	It appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking, and
150	which leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly
150	used; for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being.
150	
150	Will you explain your meaning? he said.
150	
150	I will try, I said; and I wish you would share the enquiry with me, and
150	say 'yes' or 'no' when I attempt to distinguish in my own mind what
150	branches of knowledge have this attracting power, in order that we may
150	have clearer proof that arithmetic is, as I suspect, one of them.
150	
150	Explain, he said.
150	
150	I mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds; some of them do
150	not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them;
150	while in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that
150	further enquiry is imperatively demanded.
150	
150	You are clearly referring, he said, to the manner in which the senses
150	are imposed upon by distance, and by painting in light and shade.
150	
150	No, I said, that is not at all my meaning.
150	
150	Then what is your meaning?
150	
150	When speaking of uninviting objects, I mean those which do not pass
150	from one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those which
150	do; in this latter case the sense coming upon the object, whether at a
150	distance or near, gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular
150	than of its opposite.  An illustration will make my meaning
150	clearer:--here are three fingers--a little finger, a second finger, and
150	a middle finger.
150	
150	Very good.
150	
150	You may suppose that they are seen quite close:  And here comes the
150	point.
150	
150	What is it?
150	
150	Each of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the middle or at
150	the extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin--it makes no
150	difference; a finger is a finger all the same.  In these cases a man is
150	not compelled to ask of thought the question, what is a finger? for the
150	sight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And therefore, I said, as we might expect, there is nothing here which
150	invites or excites intelligence.
150	
150	There is not, he said.
150	
150	But is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers?
150	Can sight adequately perceive them? and is no difference made by the
150	circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at
150	the extremity?  And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive
150	the qualities of thickness or thinness, or softness or hardness?  And
150	so of the other senses; do they give perfect intimations of such
150	matters?  Is not their mode of operation on this wise--the sense which
150	is concerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also
150	with the quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the
150	same thing is felt to be both hard and soft?
150	
150	You are quite right, he said.
150	
150	And must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense
150	gives of a hard which is also soft?  What, again, is the meaning of
150	light and heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which
150	is heavy, light?
150	
150	Yes, he said, these intimations which the soul receives are very
150	curious and require to be explained.
150	
150	Yes, I said, and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons to
150	her aid calculation and intelligence, that she may see whether the
150	several objects announced to her are one or two.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And if they turn out to be two, is not each of them one and different?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as in a
150	state of division, for if there were undivided they could only be
150	conceived of as one?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	The eye certainly did see both small and great, but only in a confused
150	manner; they were not distinguished.
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Whereas the thinking mind, intending to light up the chaos, was
150	compelled to reverse the process, and look at small and great as
150	separate and not confused.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Was not this the beginning of the enquiry 'What is great?' and 'What is
150	small?'
150	
150	Exactly so.
150	
150	And thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible.
150	
150	Most true.
150	
150	This was what I meant when I spoke of impressions which invited the
150	intellect, or the reverse--those which are simultaneous with opposite
150	impressions, invite thought; those which are not simultaneous do not.
150	
150	I understand, he said, and agree with you.
150	
150	And to which class do unity and number belong?
150	
150	I do not know, he replied.
150	
150	Think a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply the
150	answer; for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight
150	or by any other sense, then, as we were saying in the case of the
150	finger, there would be nothing to attract towards being; but when there
150	is some contradiction always present, and one is the reverse of one and
150	involves the conception of plurality, then thought begins to be aroused
150	within us, and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision
150	asks 'What is absolute unity?' This is the way in which the study of
150	the one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the
150	contemplation of true being.
150	
150	And surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for we see
150	the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?
150	
150	Yes, I said; and this being true of one must be equally true of all
150	number?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And they appear to lead the mind towards truth?
150	
150	Yes, in a very remarkable manner.
150	
150	Then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking, having a
150	double use, military and philosophical; for the man of war must learn
150	the art of number or he will not know how to array his troops, and the
150	philosopher also, because he has to rise out of the sea of change and
150	lay hold of true being, and therefore he must be an arithmetician.
150	
150	That is true.
150	
150	And our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe;
150	and we must endeavour to persuade those who are prescribe to be the
150	principal men of our State to go and learn arithmetic, not as amateurs,
150	but they must carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers
150	with the mind only; nor again, like merchants or retail-traders, with a
150	view to buying or selling, but for the sake of their military use, and
150	of the soul herself; and because this will be the easiest way for her
150	to pass from becoming to truth and being.
150	
150	That is excellent, he said.
150	
150	Yes, I said, and now having spoken of it, I must add how charming the
150	science is! and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end, if
150	pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!
150	
150	How do you mean?
150	
150	I mean, as I was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and elevating
150	effect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and
150	rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into
150	the argument.  You know how steadily the masters of the art repel and
150	ridicule any one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is
150	calculating, and if you divide, they multiply, taking care that one
150	shall continue one and not become lost in fractions.
150	
150	That is very true.
150	
150	Now, suppose a person were to say to them:  O my friends, what are
150	these wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you
150	say, there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal,
150	invariable, indivisible,--what would they answer?
150	
150	They would answer, as I should conceive, that they were speaking of
150	those numbers which can only be realised in thought.
150	
150	Then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary,
150	necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in
150	the attainment of pure truth?
150	
150	Yes; that is a marked characteristic of it.
150	
150	And have you further observed, that those who have a natural talent for
150	calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge; and
150	even the dull if they have had an arithmetical training, although they
150	may derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than
150	they would otherwise have been.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	And indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and not
150	many as difficult.
150	
150	You will not.
150	
150	And, for all these reasons, arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which
150	the best natures should be trained, and which must not be given up.
150	
150	I agree.
150	
150	Let this then be made one of our subjects of education.  And next,
150	shall we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us?
150	
150	You mean geometry?
150	
150	Exactly so.
150	
150	Clearly, he said, we are concerned with that part of geometry which
150	relates to war; for in pitching a camp, or taking up a position, or
150	closing or extending the lines of an army, or any other military
150	manoeuvre, whether in actual battle or on a march, it will make all the
150	difference whether a general is or is not a geometrician.
150	
150	Yes, I said, but for that purpose a very little of either geometry or
150	calculation will be enough; the question relates rather to the greater
150	and more advanced part of geometry--whether that tends in any degree to
150	make more easy the vision of the idea of good; and thither, as I was
150	saying, all things tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards
150	that place, where is the full perfection of being, which she ought, by
150	all means, to behold.
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	Then if geometry compels us to view being, it concerns us; if becoming
150	only, it does not concern us?
150	
150	Yes, that is what we assert.
150	
150	Yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny
150	that such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the
150	ordinary language of geometricians.
150	
150	How so?
150	
150	They have in view practice only, and are always speaking? in a narrow
150	and ridiculous manner, of squaring and extending and applying and the
150	like--they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily
150	life; whereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science.
150	
150	Certainly, he said.
150	
150	Then must not a further admission be made?
150	
150	What admission?
150	
150	That the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal,
150	and not of aught perishing and transient.
150	
150	That, he replied, may be readily allowed, and is true.
150	
150	Then, my noble friend, geometry will draw the soul towards truth, and
150	create the spirit of philosophy, and raise up that which is now
150	unhappily allowed to fall down.
150	
150	Nothing will be more likely to have such an effect.
150	
150	Then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants
150	of your fair city should by all means learn geometry.  Moreover the
150	science has indirect effects, which are not small.
150	
150	Of what kind? he said.
150	
150	There are the military advantages of which you spoke, I said; and in
150	all departments of knowledge, as experience proves, any one who has
150	studied geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has
150	not.
150	
150	Yes indeed, he said, there is an infinite difference between them.
150	
150	Then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our
150	youth will study?
150	
150	Let us do so, he replied.
150	
150	And suppose we make astronomy the third--what do you say?
150	
150	I am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the seasons
150	and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the
150	farmer or sailor.
150	
150	I am amused, I said, at your fear of the world, which makes you guard
150	against the appearance of insisting upon useless studies; and I quite
150	admit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of
150	the soul which, when by other pursuits lost and dimmed, is by these
150	purified and re-illumined; and is more precious far than ten thousand
150	bodily eyes, for by it alone is truth seen.  Now there are two classes
150	of persons:  one class of those who will agree with you and will take
150	your words as a revelation; another class to whom they will be utterly
150	unmeaning, and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales, for they
150	see no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them.  And therefore
150	you had better decide at once with which of the two you are proposing
150	to argue.  You will very likely say with neither, and that your chief
150	aim in carrying on the argument is your own improvement; at the same
150	time you do not grudge to others any benefit which they may receive.
150	
150	I think that I should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own
150	behalf.
150	
150	Then take a step backward, for we have gone wrong in the order of the
150	sciences.
150	
150	What was the mistake? he said.
150	
150	After plane geometry, I said, we proceeded at once to solids in
150	revolution, instead of taking solids in themselves; whereas after the
150	second dimension the third, which is concerned with cubes and
150	dimensions of depth, ought to have followed.
150	
150	That is true, Socrates; but so little seems to be known as yet about
150	these subjects.
150	
150	Why, yes, I said, and for two reasons:--in the first place, no
150	government patronises them; this leads to a want of energy in the
150	pursuit of them, and they are difficult; in the second place, students
150	cannot learn them unless they have a director.  But then a director can
150	hardly be found, and even if he could, as matters now stand, the
150	students, who are very conceited, would not attend to him.  That,
150	however, would be otherwise if the whole State became the director of
150	these studies and gave honour to them; then disciples would want to
150	come, and there would be continuous and earnest search, and discoveries
150	would be made; since even now, disregarded as they are by the world,
150	and maimed of their fair proportions, and although none of their
150	votaries can tell the use of them, still these studies force their way
150	by their natural charm, and very likely, if they had the help of the
150	State, they would some day emerge into light.
150	
150	Yes, he said, there is a remarkable charm in them.  But I do not
150	clearly understand the change in the order.  First you began with a
150	geometry of plane surfaces?
150	
150	Yes, I said.
150	
150	And you placed astronomy next, and then you made a step backward?
150	
150	Yes, and I have delayed you by my hurry; the ludicrous state of solid
150	geometry, which, in natural order, should have followed, made me pass
150	over this branch and go on to astronomy, or motion of solids.
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	Then assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence if
150	encouraged by the State, let us go on to astronomy, which will be
150	fourth.
150	
150	The right order, he replied.  And now, Socrates, as you rebuked the
150	vulgar manner in which I praised astronomy before, my praise shall be
150	given in your own spirit.  For every one, as I think, must see that
150	astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world
150	to another.
150	
150	Every one but myself, I said; to every one else this may be clear, but
150	not to me.
150	
150	And what then would you say?
150	
150	I should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy
150	appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.
150	
150	What do you mean? he asked.
150	
150	You, I replied, have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our
150	knowledge of the things above.  And I dare say that if a person were to
150	throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling, you would still
150	think that his mind was the percipient, and not his eyes.  And you are
150	very likely right, and I may be a simpleton: but, in my opinion, that
150	knowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul
150	look upwards, and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the
150	ground, seeking to learn some particular of sense, I would deny that he
150	can learn, for nothing of that sort is matter of science; his soul is
150	looking downwards, not upwards, whether his way to knowledge is by
150	water or by land, whether he floats, or only lies on his back.
150	
150	I acknowledge, he said, the justice of your rebuke.  Still, I should
150	like to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more
150	conducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking?
150	
150	I will tell you, I said:  The starry heaven which we behold is wrought
150	upon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most
150	perfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to
150	the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are
150	relative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in
150	them, in the true number and in every true figure.  Now, these are to
150	be apprehended by reason and intelligence, but not by sight.
150	
150	True, he replied.
150	
150	The spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to
150	that higher knowledge; their beauty is like the beauty of figures or
150	pictures excellently wrought by the hand of Daedalus, or some other
150	great artist, which we may chance to behold; any geometrician who saw
150	them would appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship, but he
150	would never dream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal
150	or the true double, or the truth of any other proportion.
150	
150	No, he replied, such an idea would be ridiculous.
150	
150	And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at
150	the movements of the stars?  Will he not think that heaven and the
150	things in heaven are framed by the Creator of them in the most perfect
150	manner?  But he will never imagine that the proportions of night and
150	day, or of both to the month, or of the month to the year, or of the
150	stars to these and to one another, and any other things that are
150	material and visible can also be eternal and subject to no
150	deviation--that would be absurd; and it is equally absurd to take so
150	much pains in investigating their exact truth.
150	
150	I quite agree, though I never thought of this before.
150	
150	Then, I said, in astronomy, as in geometry, we should employ problems,
150	and let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right
150	way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use.
150	
150	That, he said, is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers.
150	
150	Yes, I said; and there are many other things which must also have a
150	similar extension given to them, if our legislation is to be of any
150	value.  But can you tell me of any other suitable study?
150	
150	No, he said, not without thinking.
150	
150	Motion, I said, has many forms, and not one only; two of them are
150	obvious enough even to wits no better than ours; and there are others,
150	as I imagine, which may be left to wiser persons.
150	
150	But where are the two?
150	
150	There is a second, I said, which is the counterpart of the one already
150	named.
150	
150	And what may that be?
150	
150	The second, I said, would seem relatively to the ears to be what the
150	first is to the eyes; for I conceive that as the eyes are designed to
150	look up at the stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions; and
150	these are sister sciences--as the Pythagoreans say, and we, Glaucon,
150	agree with them?
150	
150	Yes, he replied.
150	
150	But this, I said, is a laborious study, and therefore we had better go
150	and learn of them; and they will tell us whether there are any other
150	applications of these sciences.  At the same time, we must not lose
150	sight of our own higher object.
150	
150	What is that?
150	
150	There is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach, and which our
150	pupils ought also to attain, and not to fall short of, as I was saying
150	that they did in astronomy.  For in the science of harmony, as you
150	probably know, the same thing happens.  The teachers of harmony compare
150	the sounds and consonances which are heard only, and their labour, like
150	that of the astronomers, is in vain.
150	
150	Yes, by heaven! he said; and 'tis as good as a play to hear them
150	talking about their condensed notes, as they call them; they put their
150	ears close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from
150	their neighbour's wall--one set of them declaring that they distinguish
150	an intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be
150	the unit of measurement; the others insisting that the two sounds have
150	passed into the same--either party setting their ears before their
150	understanding.
150	
150	You mean, I said, those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and
150	rack them on the pegs of the instrument:  might carry on the metaphor
150	and speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives, and
150	make accusations against the strings, both of backwardness and
150	forwardness to sound; but this would be tedious, and therefore I will
150	only say that these are not the men, and that I am referring to the
150	Pythagoreans, of whom I was just now proposing to enquire about
150	harmony.  For they too are in error, like the astronomers; they
150	investigate the numbers of the harmonies which are heard, but they
150	never attain to problems-that is to say, they never reach the natural
150	harmonies of number, or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and
150	others not.
150	
150	That, he said, is a thing of more than mortal knowledge.
150	
150	A thing, I replied, which I would rather call useful; that is, if
150	sought after with a view to the beautiful and good; but if pursued in
150	any other spirit, useless.  Very true, he said.
150	
150	Now, when all these studies reach the point of inter-communion and
150	connection with one another, and come to be considered in their mutual
150	affinities, then, I think, but not till then, will the pursuit of them
150	have a value for our objects; otherwise there is no profit in them.
150	
150	I suspect so; but you are speaking, Socrates, of a vast work.
150	
150	What do you mean?  I said; the prelude or what?  Do you not know that
150	all this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to
150	learn?  For you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a
150	dialectician?
150	
150	Assuredly not, he said; I have hardly ever known a mathematician who
150	was capable of reasoning.
150	
150	But do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason
150	will have the knowledge which we require of them?
150	
150	Neither can this be supposed.
150	
150	And so, Glaucon, I said, we have at last arrived at the hymn of
150	dialectic.  This is that strain which is of the intellect only, but
150	which the faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate; for
150	sight, as you may remember, was imagined by us after a while to behold
150	the real animals and stars, and last of all the sun himself.  And so
150	with dialectic; when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute
150	by the light of reason only, and without any assistance of sense, and
150	perseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception of
150	the absolute good, he at last finds himself at the end of the
150	intellectual world, as in the case of sight at the end of the visible.
150	
150	Exactly, he said.
150	
150	Then this is the progress which you call dialectic?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	But the release of the prisoners from chains, and their translation
150	from the shadows to the images and to the light, and the ascent from
150	the underground den to the sun, while in his presence they are vainly
150	trying to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun, but are
150	able to perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water
150	(which are divine), and are the shadows of true existence (not shadows
150	of images cast by a light of fire, which compared with the sun is only
150	an image)--this power of elevating the highest principle in the soul to
150	the contemplation of that which is best in existence, with which we may
150	compare the raising of that faculty which is the very light of the body
150	to the sight of that which is brightest in the material and visible
150	world--this power is given, as I was saying, by all that study and
150	pursuit of the arts which has been described.
150	
150	I agree in what you are saying, he replied, which may be hard to
150	believe, yet, from another point of view, is harder still to deny.
150	This, however, is not a theme to be treated of in passing only, but
150	will have to be discussed again and again.  And so, whether our
150	conclusion be true or false, let us assume all this, and proceed at
150	once from the prelude or preamble to the chief strain, and describe
150	that in like manner.  Say, then, what is the nature and what are the
150	divisions of dialectic, and what are the paths which lead thither; for
150	these paths will also lead to our final rest?
150	
150	Dear Glaucon, I said, you will not be able to follow me here, though I
150	would do my best, and you should behold not an image only but the
150	absolute truth, according to my notion.  Whether what I told you would
150	or would not have been a reality I cannot venture to say; but you would
150	have seen something like reality; of that I am confident.
150	
150	Doubtless, he replied.
150	
150	But I must also remind you, that the power of dialectic alone can
150	reveal this, and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences.
150	
150	Of that assertion you may be as confident as of the last.
150	
150	And assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of
150	comprehending by any regular process all true existence or of
150	ascertaining what each thing is in its own nature; for the arts in
150	general are concerned with the desires or opinions of men, or are
150	cultivated with a view to production and construction, or for the
150	preservation of such productions and constructions; and as to the
150	mathematical sciences which, as we were saying, have some apprehension
150	of true being--geometry and the like--they only dream about being, but
150	never can they behold the waking reality so long as they leave the
150	hypotheses which they use unexamined, and are unable to give an account
150	of them.  For when a man knows not his own first principle, and when
150	the conclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he
150	knows not what, how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can
150	ever become science?
150	
150	Impossible, he said.
150	
150	Then dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first
150	principle and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in
150	order to make her ground secure; the eye of the soul, which is
150	literally buried in an outlandish slough, is by her gentle aid lifted
150	upwards; and she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of
150	conversion, the sciences which we have been discussing.  Custom terms
150	them sciences, but they ought to have some other name, implying greater
150	clearness than opinion and less clearness than science: and this, in
150	our previous sketch, was called understanding.  But why should we
150	dispute about names when we have realities of such importance to
150	consider?
150	
150	Why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought
150	of the mind with clearness?
150	
150	At any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions; two
150	for intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division
150	science, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth
150	perception of shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and
150	intellect with being; and so to make a proportion:--
150	
150	    As being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion.
150	    And as intellect is to opinion, so is science to belief, and
150	    understanding to the perception of shadows.
150	
150	But let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the
150	subjects of opinion and of intellect, for it will be a long enquiry,
150	many times longer than this has been.
150	
150	As far as I understand, he said, I agree.
150	
150	And do you also agree, I said, in describing the dialectician as one
150	who attains a conception of the essence of each thing?  And he who does
150	not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in
150	whatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in
150	intelligence?  Will you admit so much?
150	
150	Yes, he said; how can I deny it?
150	
150	And you would say the same of the conception of the good?
150	
150	Until the person is able to abstract and define rationally the idea of
150	good, and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections, and is
150	ready to disprove them, not by appeals to opinion, but to absolute
150	truth, never faltering at any step of the argument--unless he can do
150	all this, you would say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any
150	other good; he apprehends only a shadow, if anything at all, which is
150	given by opinion and not by science;--dreaming and slumbering in this
150	life, before he is well awake here, he arrives at the world below, and
150	has his final quietus.
150	
150	In all that I should most certainly agree with you.
150	
150	And surely you would not have the children of your ideal State, whom
150	you are nurturing and educating--if the ideal ever becomes a
150	reality--you would not allow the future rulers to be like posts, having
150	no reason in them, and yet to be set in authority over the highest
150	matters?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will
150	enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering
150	questions?
150	
150	Yes, he said, you and I together will make it.
150	
150	Dialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the
150	sciences, and is set over them; no other science can be placed
150	higher--the nature of knowledge can no further go?
150	
150	I agree, he said.
150	
150	But to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they are to
150	be assigned, are questions which remain to be considered?
150	
150	Yes, clearly.
150	
150	You remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?
150	
150	Certainly, he said.
150	
150	The same natures must still be chosen, and the preference again given
150	to the surest and the bravest, and, if possible, to the fairest; and,
150	having noble and generous tempers, they should also have the natural
150	gifts which will facilitate their education.
150	
150	And what are these?
150	
150	Such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition; for the mind
150	more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of
150	gymnastics:  the toil is more entirely the mind's own, and is not
150	shared with the body.
150	
150	Very true, he replied.
150	
150	Further, he of whom we are in search should have a good memory, and be
150	an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line; or he will
150	never be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go
150	through all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of
150	him.
150	
150	Certainly, he said; he must have natural gifts.
150	
150	The mistake at present is, that those who study philosophy have no
150	vocation, and this, as I was before saying, is the reason why she has
150	fallen into disrepute:  her true sons should take her by the hand and
150	not bastards.
150	
150	What do you mean?
150	
150	In the first place, her votary should not have a lame or halting
150	industry--I mean, that he should not be half industrious and half idle:
150	as, for example, when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting, and
150	all other bodily exercises, but a hater rather than a lover of the
150	labour of learning or listening or enquiring.  Or the occupation to
150	which he devotes himself may be of an opposite kind, and he may have
150	the other sort of lameness.
150	
150	Certainly, he said.
150	
150	And as to truth, I said, is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and
150	lame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at
150	herself and others when they tell lies, but is patient of involuntary
150	falsehood, and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire
150	of ignorance, and has no shame at being detected?
150	
150	To be sure.
150	
150	And, again, in respect of temperance, courage, magnificence, and every
150	other virtue, should we not carefully distinguish between the true son
150	and the bastard? for where there is no discernment of such qualities
150	States and individuals unconsciously err and the State makes a ruler,
150	and the individual a friend, of one who, being defective in some part
150	of virtue, is in a figure lame or a bastard.
150	
150	That is very true, he said.
150	
150	All these things, then, will have to be carefully considered by us; and
150	if only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and
150	training are sound in body and mind, justice herself will have nothing
150	to say against us, and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and
150	of the State; but, if our pupils are men of another stamp, the reverse
150	will happen, and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on
150	philosophy than she has to endure at present.
150	
150	That would not be creditable.
150	
150	Certainly not, I said; and yet perhaps, in thus turning jest into
150	earnest I am equally ridiculous.
150	
150	In what respect?
150	
150	I had forgotten, I said, that we were not serious, and spoke with too
150	much excitement.  For when I saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled
150	under foot of men I could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the
150	authors of her disgrace:  and my anger made me too vehement.
150	
150	Indeed!  I was listening, and did not think so.
150	
150	But I, who am the speaker, felt that I was.  And now let me remind you
150	that, although in our former selection we chose old men, we must not do
150	so in this.  Solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he
150	grows old may learn many things--for he can no more learn much than he
150	can run much; youth is the time for any extraordinary toil.
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	And, therefore, calculation and geometry and all the other elements of
150	instruction, which are a preparation for dialectic, should be presented
150	to the mind in childhood; not, however, under any notion of forcing our
150	system of education.
150	
150	Why not?
150	
150	Because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of
150	knowledge of any kind.  Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm
150	to the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains
150	no hold on the mind.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Then, my good friend, I said, do not use compulsion, but let early
150	education be a sort of amusement; you will then be better able to find
150	out the natural bent.
150	
150	That is a very rational notion, he said.
150	
150	Do you remember that the children, too, were to be taken to see the
150	battle on horseback; and that if there were no danger they were to be
150	brought close up and, like young hounds, have a taste of blood given
150	them?
150	
150	Yes, I remember.
150	
150	The same practice may be followed, I said, in all these
150	things--labours, lessons, dangers--and he who is most at home in all of
150	them ought to be enrolled in a select number.
150	
150	At what age?
150	
150	At the age when the necessary gymnastics are over:  the period whether
150	of two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless
150	for any other purpose; for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to
150	learning; and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one
150	of the most important tests to which our youth are subjected.
150	
150	Certainly, he replied.
150	
150	After that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years
150	old will be promoted to higher honour, and the sciences which they
150	learned without any order in their early education will now be brought
150	together, and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them
150	to one another and to true being.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting
150	root.
150	
150	Yes, I said; and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion
150	of dialectical talent:  the comprehensive mind is always the
150	dialectical.
150	
150	I agree with you, he said.
150	
150	These, I said, are the points which you must consider; and those who
150	have most of this comprehension, and who are more steadfast in their
150	learning, and in their military and other appointed duties, when they
150	have arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the
150	select class, and elevated to higher honour; and you will have to prove
150	them by the help of dialectic, in order to learn which of them is able
150	to give up the use of sight and the other senses, and in company with
150	truth to attain absolute being: And here, my friend, great caution is
150	required.
150	
150	Why great caution?
150	
150	Do you not remark, I said, how great is the evil which dialectic has
150	introduced?
150	
150	What evil? he said.
150	
150	The students of the art are filled with lawlessness.
150	
150	Quite true, he said.
150	
150	Do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in
150	their case? or will you make allowance for them?
150	
150	In what way make allowance?
150	
150	I want you, I said, by way of parallel, to imagine a supposititious son
150	who is brought up in great wealth; he is one of a great and numerous
150	family, and has many flatterers.  When he grows up to manhood, he
150	learns that his alleged are not his real parents; but who the real are
150	he is unable to discover.  Can you guess how he will be likely to
150	behave towards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all
150	during the period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then
150	again when he knows?  Or shall I guess for you?
150	
150	If you please.
150	
150	Then I should say, that while he is ignorant of the truth he will be
150	likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations
150	more than the flatterers; he will be less inclined to neglect them when
150	in need, or to do or say anything against them; and he will be less
150	willing to disobey them in any important matter.
150	
150	He will.
150	
150	But when he has made the discovery, I should imagine that he would
150	diminish his honour and regard for them, and would become more devoted
150	to the flatterers; their influence over him would greatly increase; he
150	would now live after their ways, and openly associate with them, and,
150	unless he were of an unusually good disposition, he would trouble
150	himself no more about his supposed parents or other relations.
150	
150	Well, all that is very probable.  But how is the image applicable to
150	the disciples of philosophy?
150	
150	In this way:  you know that there are certain principles about justice
150	and honour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental
150	authority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.
150	
150	That is true.
150	
150	There are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter and
150	attract the soul, but do not influence those of us who have any sense
150	of right, and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their
150	fathers.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Now, when a man is in this state, and the questioning spirit asks what
150	is fair or honourable, and he answers as the legislator has taught him,
150	and then arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he is
150	driven into believing that nothing is honourable any more than
150	dishonourable, or just and good any more than the reverse, and so of
150	all the notions which he most valued, do you think that he will still
150	honour and obey them as before?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	And when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore,
150	and he fails to discover the true, can he be expected to pursue any
150	life other than that which flatters his desires?
150	
150	He cannot.
150	
150	And from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it?
150	
150	Unquestionably.
150	
150	Now all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as I have
150	described, and also, as I was just now saying, most excusable.
150	
150	Yes, he said; and, I may add, pitiable.
150	
150	Therefore, that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our
150	citizens who are now thirty years of age, every care must be taken in
150	introducing them to dialectic.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	There is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early;
150	for youngsters, as you may have observed, when they first get the taste
150	in their mouths, argue for amusement, and are always contradicting and
150	refuting others in imitation of those who refute them; like puppy-dogs,
150	they rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them.
150	
150	Yes, he said, there is nothing which they like better.
150	
150	And when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the
150	hands of many, they violently and speedily get into a way of not
150	believing anything which they believed before, and hence, not only
150	they, but philosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad
150	name with the rest of the world.
150	
150	Too true, he said.
150	
150	But when a man begins to get older, he will no longer be guilty of such
150	insanity; he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth,
150	and not the eristic, who is contradicting for the sake of amusement;
150	and the greater moderation of his character will increase instead of
150	diminishing the honour of the pursuit.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	And did we not make special provision for this, when we said that the
150	disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast, not, as now,
150	any chance aspirant or intruder?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Suppose, I said, the study of philosophy to take the place of
150	gymnastics and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively
150	for twice the number of years which were passed in bodily
150	exercise--will that be enough?
150	
150	Would you say six or four years? he asked.
150	
150	Say five years, I replied; at the end of the time they must be sent
150	down again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other
150	office which young men are qualified to hold: in this way they will get
150	their experience of life, and there will be an opportunity of trying
150	whether, when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation, they
150	will stand firm or flinch.
150	
150	And how long is this stage of their lives to last?
150	
150	Fifteen years, I answered; and when they have reached fifty years of
150	age, then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves
150	in every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at
150	last to their consummation; the time has now arrived at which they must
150	raise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all
150	things, and behold the absolute good; for that is the pattern according
150	to which they are to order the State and the lives of individuals, and
150	the remainder of their own lives also; making philosophy their chief
150	pursuit, but, when their turn comes, toiling also at politics and
150	ruling for the public good, not as though they were performing some
150	heroic action, but simply as a matter of duty; and when they have
150	brought up in each generation others like themselves and left them in
150	their place to be governors of the State, then they will depart to the
150	Islands of the Blest and dwell there; and the city will give them
150	public memorials and sacrifices and honour them, if the Pythian oracle
150	consent, as demi-gods, but if not, as in any case blessed and divine.
150	
150	You are a sculptor, Socrates, and have made statues of our governors
150	faultless in beauty.
150	
150	Yes, I said, Glaucon, and of our governesses too; for you must not
150	suppose that what I have been saying applies to men only and not to
150	women as far as their natures can go.
150	
150	There you are right, he said, since we have made them to share in all
150	things like the men.
150	
150	Well, I said, and you would agree (would you not?) that what has been
150	said about the State and the government is not a mere dream, and
150	although difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which
150	has been supposed; that is to say, when the true philosopher kings are
150	born in a State, one or more of them, despising the honours of this
150	present world which they deem mean and worthless, esteeming above all
150	things right and the honour that springs from right, and regarding
150	justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things, whose
150	ministers they are, and whose principles will be exalted by them when
150	they set in order their own city?
150	
150	How will they proceed?
150	
150	They will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of
150	the city who are more than ten years old, and will take possession of
150	their children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents;
150	these they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the laws
150	which we have given them:  and in this way the State and constitution
150	of which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain
150	happiness, and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most.
150	
150	Yes, that will be the best way.  And I think, Socrates, that you have
150	very well described how, if ever, such a constitution might come into
150	being.
150	
150	Enough then of the perfect State, and of the man who bears its
150	image--there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him.
150	
150	There is no difficulty, he replied; and I agree with you in thinking
150	that nothing more need be said.
150	
150

150	BOOK VIII
150	
150	
150	SOCRATES - GLAUCON
150	
150	AND so, Glaucon, we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect
150	State wives and children are to be in common; and that all education
150	and the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common, and the best
150	philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings?
150	
150	That, replied Glaucon, has been acknowledged.
150	
150	Yes, I said; and we have further acknowledged that the governors, when
150	appointed themselves, will take their soldiers and place them in houses
150	such as we were describing, which are common to all, and contain
150	nothing private, or individual; and about their property, you remember
150	what we agreed?
150	
150	Yes, I remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions
150	of mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving
150	from the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their
150	maintenance, and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole
150	State.
150	
150	True, I said; and now that this division of our task is concluded, let
150	us find the point at which we digressed, that we may return into the
150	old path.
150	
150	There is no difficulty in returning; you implied, then as now, that you
150	had finished the description of the State:  you said that such a State
150	was good, and that the man was good who answered to it, although, as
150	now appears, you had more excellent things to relate both of State and
150	man.  And you said further, that if this was the true form, then the
150	others were false; and of the false forms, you said, as I remember,
150	that there were four principal ones, and that their defects, and the
150	defects of the individuals corresponding to them, were worth examining.
150	When we had seen all the individuals, and finally agreed as to who was
150	the best and who was the worst of them, we were to consider whether the
150	best was not also the happiest, and the worst the most miserable.  I
150	asked you what were the four forms of government of which you spoke,
150	and then Polemarchus and Adeimantus put in their word; and you began
150	again, and have found your way to the point at which we have now
150	arrived.
150	
150	Your recollection, I said, is most exact.
150	
150	Then, like a wrestler, he replied, you must put yourself again in the
150	same position; and let me ask the same questions, and do you give me
150	the same answer which you were about to give me then.
150	
150	Yes, if I can, I will, I said.
150	
150	I shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions of
150	which you were speaking.
150	
150	That question, I said, is easily answered:  the four governments of
150	which I spoke, so far as they have distinct names, are, first, those of
150	Crete and Sparta, which are generally applauded; what is termed
150	oligarchy comes next; this is not equally approved, and is a form of
150	government which teems with evils:  thirdly, democracy, which naturally
150	follows oligarchy, although very different: and lastly comes tyranny,
150	great and famous, which differs from them all, and is the fourth and
150	worst disorder of a State.  I do not know, do you? of any other
150	constitution which can be said to have a distinct character.  There are
150	lordships and principalities which are bought and sold, and some other
150	intermediate forms of government.  But these are nondescripts and may
150	be found equally among Hellenes and among barbarians.
150	
150	Yes, he replied, we certainly hear of many curious forms of government
150	which exist among them.
150	
150	Do you know, I said, that governments vary as the dispositions of men
150	vary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the
150	other?  For we cannot suppose that States are made of 'oak and rock,'
150	and not out of the human natures which are in them, and which in a
150	figure turn the scale and draw other things after them?
150	
150	Yes, he said, the States are as the men are; they grow out of human
150	characters.
150	
150	Then if the constitutions of States are five, the dispositions of
150	individual minds will also be five?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Him who answers to aristocracy, and whom we rightly call just and good,
150	we have already described.
150	
150	We have.
150	
150	Then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures, being
150	the contentious and ambitious, who answer to the Spartan polity; also
150	the oligarchical, democratical, and tyrannical.  Let us place the most
150	just by the side of the most unjust, and when we see them we shall be
150	able to compare the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads
150	a life of pure justice or pure injustice.  The enquiry will then be
150	completed.  And we shall know whether we ought to pursue injustice, as
150	Thrasymachus advises, or in accordance with the conclusions of the
150	argument to prefer justice.
150	
150	Certainly, he replied, we must do as you say.
150	
150	Shall we follow our old plan, which we adopted with a view to
150	clearness, of taking the State first and then proceeding to the
150	individual, and begin with the government of honour?--I know of no name
150	for such a government other than timocracy, or perhaps timarchy.  We
150	will compare with this the like character in the individual; and, after
150	that, consider oligarchical man; and then again we will turn our
150	attention to democracy and the democratical man; and lastly, we will go
150	and view the city of tyranny, and once more take a look into the
150	tyrant's soul, and try to arrive at a satisfactory decision.
150	
150	That way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable.
150	
150	First, then, I said, let us enquire how timocracy (the government of
150	honour) arises out of aristocracy (the government of the best).
150	Clearly, all political changes originate in divisions of the actual
150	governing power; a government which is united, however small, cannot be
150	moved.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	In what way, then, will our city be moved, and in what manner the two
150	classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with one
150	another?  Shall we, after the manner of Homer, pray the Muses to tell
150	us 'how discord first arose'? Shall we imagine them in solemn mockery,
150	to play and jest with us as if we were children, and to address us in a
150	lofty tragic vein, making believe to be in earnest?
150	
150	How would they address us?
150	
150	After this manner:--A city which is thus constituted can hardly be
150	shaken; but, seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an
150	end, even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever, but will
150	in time be dissolved.  And this is the dissolution:--In plants that
150	grow in the earth, as well as in animals that move on the earth's
150	surface, fertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the
150	circumferences of the circles of each are completed, which in
150	short-lived existences pass over a short space, and in long-lived ones
150	over a long space.  But to the knowledge of human fecundity and
150	sterility all the wisdom and education of your rulers will not attain;
150	the laws which regulate them will not be discovered by an intelligence
150	which is alloyed with sense, but will escape them, and they will bring
150	children into the world when they ought not.  Now that which is of
150	divine birth has a period which is contained in a perfect number, but
150	the period of human birth is comprehended in a number in which first
150	increments by involution and evolution (or squared and cubed) obtaining
150	three intervals and four terms of like and unlike, waxing and waning
150	numbers, make all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another.
150	The base of these (3) with a third added (4) when combined with five
150	(20) and raised to the third power furnishes two harmonies; the first a
150	square which is a hundred times as great (400 = 4 X 100), and the other
150	a figure having one side equal to the former, but oblong, consisting of
150	a hundred numbers squared upon rational diameters of a square (i. e.
150	omitting fractions), the side of which is five (7 X 7 = 49 X 100 =
150	4900), each of them being less by one (than the perfect square which
150	includes the fractions, sc. 50) or less by two perfect squares of
150	irrational diameters (of a square the side of which is five = 50 + 50 =
150	100); and a hundred cubes of three (27 X 100 = 2700 + 4900 + 400 =
150	8000). Now this number represents a geometrical figure which has
150	control over the good and evil of births.  For when your guardians are
150	ignorant of the law of births, and unite bride and bridegroom out of
150	season, the children will not be goodly or fortunate.  And though only
150	the best of them will be appointed by their predecessors, still they
150	will be unworthy to hold their fathers' places, and when they come into
150	power as guardians, they will soon be found to fall in taking care of
150	us, the Muses, first by under-valuing music; which neglect will soon
150	extend to gymnastic; and hence the young men of your State will be less
150	cultivated.  In the succeeding generation rulers will be appointed who
150	have lost the guardian power of testing the metal of your different
150	races, which, like Hesiod's, are of gold and silver and brass and iron.
150	And so iron will be mingled with silver, and brass with gold, and hence
150	there will arise dissimilarity and inequality and irregularity, which
150	always and in all places are causes of hatred and war.  This the Muses
150	affirm to be the stock from which discord has sprung, wherever arising;
150	and this is their answer to us.
150	
150	Yes, and we may assume that they answer truly.
150	
150	Why, yes, I said, of course they answer truly; how can the Muses speak
150	falsely?
150	
150	And what do the Muses say next?
150	
150	When discord arose, then the two races were drawn different ways: the
150	iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and
150	silver; but the gold and silver races, not wanting money but having the
150	true riches in their own nature, inclined towards virtue and the
150	ancient order of things.  There was a battle between them, and at last
150	they agreed to distribute their land and houses among individual
150	owners; and they enslaved their friends and maintainers, whom they had
150	formerly protected in the condition of freemen, and made of them
150	subjects and servants; and they themselves were engaged in war and in
150	keeping a watch against them.
150	
150	I believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change.
150	
150	And the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate
150	between oligarchy and aristocracy?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Such will be the change, and after the change has been made, how will
150	they proceed?  Clearly, the new State, being in a mean between
150	oligarchy and the perfect State, will partly follow one and partly the
150	other, and will also have some peculiarities.
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	In the honour given to rulers, in the abstinence of the warrior class
150	from agriculture, handicrafts, and trade in general, in the institution
150	of common meals, and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military
150	training--in all these respects this State will resemble the former.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	But in the fear of admitting philosophers to power, because they are no
150	longer to be had simple and earnest, but are made up of mixed elements;
150	and in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters, who
150	are by nature fitted for war rather than peace; and in the value set by
150	them upon military stratagems and contrivances, and in the waging of
150	everlasting wars--this State will be for the most part peculiar.
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Yes, I said; and men of this stamp will be covetous of money, like
150	those who live in oligarchies; they will have, a fierce secret longing
150	after gold and silver, which they will hoard in dark places, having
150	magazines and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment
150	of them; also castles which are just nests for their eggs, and in which
150	they will spend large sums on their wives, or on any others whom they
150	please.
150	
150	That is most true, he said.
150	
150	And they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the
150	money which they prize; they will spend that which is another man's on
150	the gratification of their desires, stealing their pleasures and
150	running away like children from the law, their father: they have been
150	schooled not by gentle influences but by force, for they have neglected
150	her who is the true Muse, the companion of reason and philosophy, and
150	have honoured gymnastic more than music.
150	
150	Undoubtedly, he said, the form of government which you describe is a
150	mixture of good and evil.
150	
150	Why, there is a mixture, I said; but one thing, and one thing only, is
150	predominantly seen,--the spirit of contention and ambition; and these
150	are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element.
150	
150	Assuredly, he said.
150	
150	Such is the origin and such the character of this State, which has been
150	described in outline only; the more perfect execution was not required,
150	for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and
150	most perfectly unjust; and to go through all the States and all the
150	characters of men, omitting none of them, would be an interminable
150	labour.
150	
150	Very true, he replied.
150	
150	Now what man answers to this form of government-how did he come into
150	being, and what is he like?
150	
150	SOCRATES - ADEIMANTUS
150	
150	I think, said Adeimantus, that in the spirit of contention which
150	characterises him, he is not unlike our friend Glaucon.
150	
150	Perhaps, I said, he may be like him in that one point; but there are
150	other respects in which he is very different.
150	
150	In what respects?
150	
150	He should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and yet a
150	friend of culture; and he should be a good listener, but no speaker.
150	Such a person is apt to be rough with slaves, unlike the educated man,
150	who is too proud for that; and he will also be courteous to freemen,
150	and remarkably obedient to authority; he is a lover of power and a
150	lover of honour; claiming to be a ruler, not because he is eloquent, or
150	on any ground of that sort, but because he is a soldier and has
150	performed feats of arms; he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and
150	of the chase.
150	
150	Yes, that is the type of character which answers to timocracy.
150	
150	Such an one will despise riches only when he is young; but as he gets
150	older he will be more and more attracted to them, because he has a
150	piece of the avaricious nature in him, and is not singleminded towards
150	virtue, having lost his best guardian.
150	
150	Who was that? said Adeimantus.
150	
150	Philosophy, I said, tempered with music, who comes and takes her abode
150	in a man, and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life.
150	
150	Good, he said.
150	
150	Such, I said, is the timocratical youth, and he is like the
150	timocratical State.
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	His origin is as follows:--He is often the young son of a grave father,
150	who dwells in an ill-governed city, of which he declines the honours
150	and offices, and will not go to law, or exert himself in any way, but
150	is ready to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble.
150	
150	And how does the son come into being?
150	
150	The character of the son begins to develop when he hears his mother
150	complaining that her husband has no place in the government, of which
150	the consequence is that she has no precedence among other women.
150	Further, when she sees her husband not very eager about money, and
150	instead of battling and railing in the law courts or assembly, taking
150	whatever happens to him quietly; and when she observes that his
150	thoughts always centre in himself, while he treats her with very
150	considerable indifference, she is annoyed, and says to her son that his
150	father is only half a man and far too easy-going: adding all the other
150	complaints about her own ill-treatment which women are so fond of
150	rehearsing.
150	
150	Yes, said Adeimantus, they give us plenty of them, and their complaints
150	are so like themselves.
150	
150	And you know, I said, that the old servants also, who are supposed to
150	be attached to the family, from time to time talk privately in the same
150	strain to the son; and if they see any one who owes money to his
150	father, or is wronging him in any way, and he falls to prosecute them,
150	they tell the youth that when he grows up he must retaliate upon people
150	of this sort, and be more of a man than his father.  He has only to
150	walk abroad and he hears and sees the same sort of thing: those who do
150	their own business in the city are called simpletons, and held in no
150	esteem, while the busy-bodies are honoured and applauded.  The result
150	is that the young man, hearing and seeing all these thing--hearing too,
150	the words of his father, and having a nearer view of his way of life,
150	and making comparisons of him and others--is drawn opposite ways: while
150	his father is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his
150	soul, the others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive; and he
150	being not originally of a bad nature, but having kept bad company, is
150	at last brought by their joint influence to a middle point, and gives
150	up the kingdom which is within him to the middle principle of
150	contentiousness and passion, and becomes arrogant and ambitious.
150	
150	You seem to me to have described his origin perfectly.
150	
150	Then we have now, I said, the second form of government and the second
150	type of character?
150	
150	We have.
150	
150	Next, let us look at another man who, as Aeschylus says,
150	
150	    Is set over against another State;
150	
150	or rather, as our plan requires, begin with the State.
150	
150	By all means.
150	
150	I believe that oligarchy follows next in order.
150	
150	And what manner of government do you term oligarchy?
150	
150	A government resting on a valuation of property, in which the rich have
150	power and the poor man is deprived of it.
150	
150	I understand, he replied.
150	
150	Ought I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to
150	oligarchy arises?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Well, I said, no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes
150	into the other.
150	
150	How?
150	
150	The accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is ruin
150	the of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for what do
150	they or their wives care about the law?
150	
150	Yes, indeed.
150	
150	And then one, seeing another grow rich, seeks to rival him, and thus
150	the great mass of the citizens become lovers of money.
150	
150	Likely enough.
150	
150	And so they grow richer and richer, and the more they think of making a
150	fortune the less they think of virtue; for when riches and virtue are
150	placed together in the scales of the balance, the one always rises as
150	the other falls.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the State,
150	virtue and the virtuous are dishonoured.
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	And what is honoured is cultivated, and that which has no honour is
150	neglected.
150	
150	That is obvious.
150	
150	And so at last, instead of loving contention and glory, men become
150	lovers of trade and money; they honour and look up to the rich man, and
150	make a ruler of him, and dishonour the poor man.
150	
150	They do so.
150	
150	They next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the
150	qualification of citizenship; the sum is higher in one place and lower
150	in another, as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive; and they allow
150	no one whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in
150	the government.  These changes in the constitution they effect by force
150	of arms, if intimidation has not already done their work.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And this, speaking generally, is the way in which oligarchy is
150	established.
150	
150	Yes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form of
150	government, and what are the defects of which we were speaking?
150	
150	First of all, I said, consider the nature of the qualification just
150	think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their
150	property, and a poor man were refused permission to steer, even though
150	he were a better pilot?
150	
150	You mean that they would shipwreck?
150	
150	Yes; and is not this true of the government of anything?
150	
150	I should imagine so.
150	
150	Except a city?--or would you include a city?
150	
150	Nay, he said, the case of a city is the strongest of all, inasmuch as
150	the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all.
150	
150	This, then, will be the first great defect of oligarchy?
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	And here is another defect which is quite as bad.
150	
150	What defect?
150	
150	The inevitable division:  such a State is not one, but two States, the
150	one of poor, the other of rich men; and they are living on the same
150	spot and always conspiring against one another.
150	
150	That, surely, is at least as bad.
150	
150	Another discreditable feature is, that, for a like reason, they are
150	incapable of carrying on any war.  Either they arm the multitude, and
150	then they are more afraid of them than of the enemy; or, if they do not
150	call them out in the hour of battle, they are oligarchs indeed, few to
150	fight as they are few to rule.  And at the same time their fondness for
150	money makes them unwilling to pay taxes.
150	
150	How discreditable!
150	
150	And, as we said before, under such a constitution the same persons have
150	too many callings--they are husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors, all in
150	one.  Does that look well?
150	
150	Anything but well.
150	
150	There is another evil which is, perhaps, the greatest of all, and to
150	which this State first begins to be liable.
150	
150	What evil?
150	
150	A man may sell all that he has, and another may acquire his property;
150	yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a
150	part, being neither trader, nor artisan, nor horseman, nor hoplite, but
150	only a poor, helpless creature.
150	
150	Yes, that is an evil which also first begins in this State.
150	
150	The evil is certainly not prevented there; for oligarchies have both
150	the extremes of great wealth and utter poverty.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	But think again:  In his wealthy days, while he was spending his money,
150	was a man of this sort a whit more good to the State for the purposes
150	of citizenship?  Or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body,
150	although in truth he was neither ruler nor subject, but just a
150	spendthrift?
150	
150	As you say, he seemed to be a ruler, but was only a spendthrift.
150	
150	May we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the
150	drone in the honeycomb, and that the one is the plague of the city as
150	the other is of the hive?
150	
150	Just so, Socrates.
150	
150	And God has made the flying drones, Adeimantus, all without stings,
150	whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but
150	others have dreadful stings; of the stingless class are those who in
150	their old age end as paupers; of the stingers come all the criminal
150	class, as they are termed.
150	
150	Most true, he said.
150	
150	Clearly then, whenever you see paupers in a State, somewhere in that
150	neighborhood there are hidden away thieves, and cutpurses and robbers
150	of temples, and all sorts of malefactors.
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	Well, I said, and in oligarchical States do you not find paupers?
150	
150	Yes, he said; nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler.
150	
150	And may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals
150	to be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities
150	are careful to restrain by force?
150	
150	Certainly, we may be so bold.
150	
150	The existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education,
150	ill-training, and an evil constitution of the State?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Such, then, is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy; and there
150	may be many other evils.
150	
150	Very likely.
150	
150	Then oligarchy, or the form of government in which the rulers are
150	elected for their wealth, may now be dismissed.  Let us next proceed to
150	consider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this
150	State.
150	
150	By all means.
150	
150	Does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise?
150	
150	How?
150	
150	A time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son: at first
150	he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps, but
150	presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the State as upon
150	a sunken reef, and he and all that he has is lost; he may have been a
150	general or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a
150	prejudice raised by informers, and either put to death, or exiled, or
150	deprived of the privileges of a citizen, and all his property taken
150	from him.
150	
150	Nothing more likely.
150	
150	And the son has seen and known all this--he is a ruined man, and his
150	fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion head-foremost from
150	his bosom's throne; humbled by poverty he takes to money-making and by
150	mean and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together.  Is not
150	such an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the
150	vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him, girt
150	with tiara and chain and scimitar?
150	
150	Most true, he replied.
150	
150	And when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground
150	obediently on either side of their sovereign, and taught them to know
150	their place, he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be
150	turned into larger ones, and will not allow the other to worship and
150	admire anything but riches and rich men, or to be ambitious of anything
150	so much as the acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it.
150	
150	Of all changes, he said, there is none so speedy or so sure as the
150	conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one.
150	
150	And the avaricious, I said, is the oligarchical youth?
150	
150	Yes, he said; at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like
150	the State out of which oligarchy came.
150	
150	Let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them.
150	
150	Very good.
150	
150	First, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set upon
150	wealth?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Also in their penurious, laborious character; the individual only
150	satisfies his necessary appetites, and confines his expenditure to
150	them; his other desires he subdues, under the idea that they are
150	unprofitable.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	He is a shabby fellow, who saves something out of everything and makes
150	a purse for himself; and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar
150	applaud.  Is he not a true image of the State which he represents?
150	
150	He appears to me to be so; at any rate money is highly valued by him as
150	well as by the State.
150	
150	You see that he is not a man of cultivation, I said.
150	
150	I imagine not, he said; had he been educated he would never have made a
150	blind god director of his chorus, or given him chief honour.
150	
150	Excellent!  I said.  Yet consider:  Must we not further admit that
150	owing to this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike
150	desires as of pauper and rogue, which are forcibly kept down by his
150	general habit of life?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his
150	rogueries?
150	
150	Where must I look?
150	
150	You should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting
150	dishonestly, as in the guardianship of an orphan.
150	
150	Aye.
150	
150	It will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give
150	him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced
150	virtue; not making them see that they are wrong, or taming them by
150	reason, but by necessity and fear constraining them, and because he
150	trembles for his possessions.
150	
150	To be sure.
150	
150	Yes, indeed, my dear friend, but you will find that the natural desires
150	of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to
150	spend what is not his own.
150	
150	Yes, and they will be strong in him too.
150	
150	The man, then, will be at war with himself; he will be two men, and not
150	one; but, in general, his better desires will be found to prevail over
150	his inferior ones.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	For these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most
150	people; yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will
150	flee far away and never come near him.
150	
150	I should expect so.
150	
150	And surely, the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a
150	State for any prize of victory, or other object of honourable ambition;
150	he will not spend his money in the contest for glory; so afraid is he
150	of awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join
150	in the struggle; in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small
150	part only of his resources, and the result commonly is that he loses
150	the prize and saves his money.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Can we any longer doubt, then, that the miser and money-maker answers
150	to the oligarchical State?
150	
150	There can be no doubt.
150	
150	Next comes democracy; of this the origin and nature have still to be
150	considered by us; and then we will enquire into the ways of the
150	democratic man, and bring him up for judgement.
150	
150	That, he said, is our method.
150	
150	Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy
150	arise?  Is it not on this wise?--The good at which such a State alms is
150	to become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?
150	
150	What then?
150	
150	The rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth,
150	refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth
150	because they gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy
150	up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance?
150	
150	To be sure.
150	
150	There can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of
150	moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same State to any
150	considerable extent; one or the other will be disregarded.
150	
150	That is tolerably clear.
150	
150	And in oligarchical States, from the general spread of carelessness and
150	extravagance, men of good family have often been reduced to beggary?
150	
150	Yes, often.
150	
150	And still they remain in the city; there they are, ready to sting and
150	fully armed, and some of them owe money, some have forfeited their
150	citizenship; a third class are in both predicaments; and they hate and
150	conspire against those who have got their property, and against
150	everybody else, and are eager for revolution.
150	
150	That is true.
150	
150	On the other hand, the men of business, stooping as they walk, and
150	pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined, insert
150	their sting--that is, their money--into some one else who is not on his
150	guard against them, and recover the parent sum many times over
150	multiplied into a family of children:  and so they make drone and
150	pauper to abound in the State.
150	
150	Yes, he said, there are plenty of them--that is certain.
150	
150	The evil blazes up like a fire; and they will not extinguish it, either
150	by restricting a man's use of his own property, or by another remedy:
150	
150	What other?
150	
150	One which is the next best, and has the advantage of compelling the
150	citizens to look to their characters:--Let there be a general rule that
150	every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk, and
150	there will be less of this scandalous money-making, and the evils of
150	which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the State.
150	
150	Yes, they will be greatly lessened.
150	
150	At present the governors, induced by the motives which I have named,
150	treat their subjects badly; while they and their adherents, especially
150	the young men of the governing class, are habituated to lead a life of
150	luxury and idleness both of body and mind; they do nothing, and are
150	incapable of resisting either pleasure or pain.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	They themselves care only for making money, and are as indifferent as
150	the pauper to the cultivation of virtue.
150	
150	Yes, quite as indifferent.
150	
150	Such is the state of affairs which prevails among them.  And often
150	rulers and their subjects may come in one another's way, whether on a
150	pilgrimage or a march, as fellow-soldiers or fellow-sailors; aye, and
150	they may observe the behaviour of each other in the very moment of
150	danger--for where danger is, there is no fear that the poor will be
150	despised by the rich--and very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be
150	placed in battle at the side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his
150	complexion and has plenty of superfluous flesh--when he sees such an
150	one puffing and at his wit's end, how can he avoid drawing the
150	conclusion that men like him are only rich because no one has the
150	courage to despoil them?  And when they meet in private will not people
150	be saying to one another 'Our warriors are not good for much'?
150	
150	Yes, he said, I am quite aware that this is their way of talking.
150	
150	And, as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from
150	without may bring on illness, and sometimes even when there is no
150	external provocation a commotion may arise within-in the same way
150	wherever there is weakness in the State there is also likely to be
150	illness, of which the occasions may be very slight, the one party
150	introducing from without their oligarchical, the other their
150	democratical allies, and then the State falls sick, and is at war with
150	herself; and may be at times distracted, even when there is no external
150	cause.
150	
150	Yes, surely.
150	
150	And then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their
150	opponents, slaughtering some and banishing some, while to the remainder
150	they give an equal share of freedom and power; and this is the form of
150	government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that is the nature of democracy, whether the revolution
150	has been effected by arms, or whether fear has caused the opposite
150	party to withdraw.
150	
150	And now what is their manner of life, and what sort of a government
150	have they? for as the government is, such will be the man.
150	
150	Clearly, he said.
150	
150	In the first place, are they not free; and is not the city full of
150	freedom and frankness--a man may say and do what he likes?
150	
150	'Tis said so, he replied.
150	
150	And where freedom is, the individual is clearly able to order for
150	himself his own life as he pleases?
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	Then in this kind of State there will be the greatest variety of human
150	natures?
150	
150	There will.
150	
150	This, then, seems likely to be the fairest of States, being an
150	embroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower.  And just
150	as women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things
150	most charming, so there are many men to whom this State, which is
150	spangled with the manners and characters of mankind, will appear to be
150	the fairest of States.
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Yes, my good Sir, and there will be no better in which to look for a
150	government.
150	
150	Why?
150	
150	Because of the liberty which reigns there--they have a complete
150	assortment of constitutions; and he who has a mind to establish a
150	State, as we have been doing, must go to a democracy as he would to a
150	bazaar at which they sell them, and pick out the one that suits him;
150	then, when he has made his choice, he may found his State.
150	
150	He will be sure to have patterns enough.
150	
150	And there being no necessity, I said, for you to govern in this State,
150	even if you have the capacity, or to be governed, unless you like, or
150	go to war when the rest go to war, or to be at peace when others are at
150	peace, unless you are so disposed--there being no necessity also,
150	because some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast, that you
150	should not hold office or be a dicast, if you have a fancy--is not this
150	a way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful
150	
150	For the moment, yes.
150	
150	And is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite
150	charming?  Have you not observed how, in a democracy, many persons,
150	although they have been sentenced to death or exile, just stay where
150	they are and walk about the world--the gentleman parades like a hero,
150	and nobody sees or cares?
150	
150	Yes, he replied, many and many a one.
150	
150	See too, I said, the forgiving spirit of democracy, and the 'don't
150	care' about trifles, and the disregard which she shows of all the fine
150	principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the
150	city--as when we said that, except in the case of some rarely gifted
150	nature, there never will be a good man who has not from his childhood
150	been used to play amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a
150	study--how grandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours
150	under her feet, never giving a thought to the pursuits which make a
150	statesman, and promoting to honour any one who professes to be the
150	people's friend.
150	
150	Yes, she is of a noble spirit.
150	
150	These and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy, which
150	is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and
150	dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike.
150	
150	We know her well.
150	
150	Consider now, I said, what manner of man the individual is, or rather
150	consider, as in the case of the State, how he comes into being.
150	
150	Very good, he said.
150	
150	Is not this the way--he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical
150	father who has trained him in his own habits?
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	And, like his father, he keeps under by force the pleasures which are
150	of the spending and not of the getting sort, being those which are
150	called unnecessary?
150	
150	Obviously.
150	
150	Would you like, for the sake of clearness, to distinguish which are the
150	necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures?
150	
150	I should.
150	
150	Are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and of
150	which the satisfaction is a benefit to us?  And they are rightly so,
150	because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and
150	what is necessary, and cannot help it.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?
150	
150	We are not.
150	
150	And the desires of which a man may get rid, if he takes pains from his
150	youth upwards--of which the presence, moreover, does no good, and in
150	some cases the reverse of good--shall we not be right in saying that
150	all these are unnecessary?
150	
150	Yes, certainly.
150	
150	Suppose we select an example of either kind, in order that we may have
150	a general notion of them?
150	
150	Very good.
150	
150	Will not the desire of eating, that is, of simple food and condiments,
150	in so far as they are required for health and strength, be of the
150	necessary class?
150	
150	That is what I should suppose.
150	
150	The pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways; it does us good and it
150	is essential to the continuance of life?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	But the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for
150	health?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And the desire which goes beyond this, or more delicate food, or other
150	luxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and
150	trained in youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul
150	in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue, may be rightly called unnecessary?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	May we not say that these desires spend, and that the others make money
150	because they conduce to production?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds
150	good?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures
150	and desires of this sort, and was the slave of the unnecessary desires,
150	whereas he who was subject o the necessary only was miserly and
150	oligarchical?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Again, let us see how the democratical man grows out of the
150	oligarchical: the following, as I suspect, is commonly the process.
150	
150	What is the process?
150	
150	When a young man who has been brought up as we were just now
150	describing, in a vulgar and miserly way, has tasted drones' honey and
150	has come to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to
150	provide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of
150	pleasure--then, as you may imagine, the change will begin of the
150	oligarchical principle within him into the democratical?
150	
150	Inevitably.
150	
150	And as in the city like was helping like, and the change was effected
150	by an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens, so
150	too the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without
150	to assist the desires within him, that which is and alike again helping
150	that which is akin and alike?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within
150	him, whether the influence of a father or of kindred, advising or
150	rebuking him, then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite
150	faction, and he goes to war with himself.
150	
150	It must be so.
150	
150	And there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the
150	oligarchical, and some of his desires die, and others are banished; a
150	spirit of reverence enters into the young man's soul and order is
150	restored.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that sometimes happens.
150	
150	And then, again, after the old desires have been driven out, fresh ones
150	spring up, which are akin to them, and because he, their father, does
150	not know how to educate them, wax fierce and numerous.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that is apt to be the way.
150	
150	They draw him to his old associates, and holding secret intercourse
150	with them, breed and multiply in him.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	At length they seize upon the citadel of the young man's soul, which
150	they perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and
150	true words, which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to
150	the gods, and are their best guardians and sentinels.
150	
150	None better.
150	
150	False and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their
150	place.
150	
150	They are certain to do so.
150	
150	And so the young man returns into the country of the lotus-eaters, and
150	takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men; and if any help be
150	sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him, the aforesaid vain
150	conceits shut the gate of the king's fastness; and they will neither
150	allow the embassy itself to enter, private if private advisers offer
150	the fatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive
150	them.  There is a battle and they gain the day, and then modesty, which
150	they call silliness, is ignominiously thrust into exile by them, and
150	temperance, which they nickname unmanliness, is trampled in the mire
150	and cast forth; they persuade men that moderation and orderly
150	expenditure are vulgarity and meanness, and so, by the help of a rabble
150	of evil appetites, they drive them beyond the border.
150	
150	Yes, with a will.
150	
150	And when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is now
150	in their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries,
150	the next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy
150	and waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads,
150	and a great company with them, hymning their praises and calling them
150	by sweet names; insolence they term breeding, and anarchy liberty, and
150	waste magnificence, and impudence courage.  And so the young man passes
150	out of his original nature, which was trained in the school of
150	necessity, into the freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary
150	pleasures.
150	
150	Yes, he said, the change in him is visible enough.
150	
150	After this he lives on, spending his money and labour and time on
150	unnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones; but if he be
150	fortunate, and is not too much disordered in his wits, when years have
150	elapsed, and the heyday of passion is over--supposing that he then
150	re-admits into the city some part of the exiled virtues, and does not
150	wholly give himself up to their successors--in that case he balances
150	his pleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium, putting the
150	government of himself into the hands of the one which comes first and
150	wins the turn; and when he has had enough of that, then into the hands
150	of another; he despises none of them but encourages them all equally.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	Neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of
150	advice; if any one says to him that some pleasures are the
150	satisfactions of good and noble desires, and others of evil desires,
150	and that he ought to use and honour some and chastise and master the
150	others--whenever this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says
150	that they are all alike, and that one is as good as another.
150	
150	Yes, he said; that is the way with him.
150	
150	Yes, I said, he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the
150	hour; and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute;
150	then he becomes a water-drinker, and tries to get thin; then he takes a
150	turn at gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything, then
150	once more living the life of a philosopher; often he-is busy with
150	politics, and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into
150	his head; and, if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior, off he is
150	in that direction, or of men of business, once more in that.  His life
150	has neither law nor order; and this distracted existence he terms joy
150	and bliss and freedom; and so he goes on.
150	
150	Yes, he replied, he is all liberty and equality.
150	
150	Yes, I said; his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the
150	lives of many;--he answers to the State which we described as fair and
150	spangled.  And many a man and many a woman will take him for their
150	pattern, and many a constitution and many an example of manners is
150	contained in him.
150	
150	Just so.
150	
150	Let him then be set over against democracy; he may truly be called the
150	democratic man.
150	
150	Let that be his place, he said.
150	
150	Last of all comes the most beautiful of all, man and State alike,
150	tyranny and the tyrant; these we have now to consider.
150	
150	Quite true, he said.
150	
150	Say then, my friend, in what manner does tyranny arise?--that it has a
150	democratic origin is evident.
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	And does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as
150	democracy from oligarchy--I mean, after a sort?
150	
150	How?
150	
150	The good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it
150	was maintained was excess of wealth--am I not right?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things
150	for the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings
150	her to dissolution?
150	
150	What good?
150	
150	Freedom, I replied; which, as they tell you in a democracy, is the
150	glory of the State--and that therefore in a democracy alone will the
150	freeman of nature deign to dwell.
150	
150	Yes; the saying is in everybody's mouth.
150	
150	I was going to observe, that the insatiable desire of this and the
150	neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy, which
150	occasions a demand for tyranny.
150	
150	How so?
150	
150	When a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cupbearers
150	presiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine
150	of freedom, then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a
150	plentiful draught, she calls them to account and punishes them, and
150	says that they are cursed oligarchs.
150	
150	Yes, he replied, a very common occurrence.
150	
150	Yes, I said; and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves
150	who hug their chains and men of naught; she would have subjects who are
150	like rulers, and rulers who are like subjects: these are men after her
150	own heart, whom she praises and honours both in private and public.
150	Now, in such a State, can liberty have any limit?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	By degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses, and ends by
150	getting among the animals and infecting them.
150	
150	How do you mean?
150	
150	I mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his
150	sons and to fear them, and the son is on a level with his father, he
150	having no respect or reverence for either of his parents; and this is
150	his freedom, and metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with
150	the metic, and the stranger is quite as good as either.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that is the way.
150	
150	And these are not the only evils, I said--there are several lesser
150	ones: In such a state of society the master fears and flatters his
150	scholars, and the scholars despise their masters and tutors; young and
150	old are all alike; and the young man is on a level with the old, and is
150	ready to compete with him in word or deed; and old men condescend to
150	the young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety; they are loth to be
150	thought morose and authoritative, and therefore they adopt the manners
150	of the young.
150	
150	Quite true, he said.
150	
150	The last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with
150	money, whether male or female, is just as free as his or her purchaser;
150	nor must I forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes
150	in relation to each other.
150	
150	Why not, as Aeschylus says, utter the word which rises to our lips?
150	
150	That is what I am doing, I replied; and I must add that no one who does
150	not know would believe, how much greater is the liberty which the
150	animals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in
150	any other State:  for truly, the she-dogs, as the proverb says, are as
150	good as their she-mistresses, and the horses and asses have a way of
150	marching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen; and they
150	will run at anybody who comes in their way if he does not leave the
150	road clear for them:  and all things are just ready to burst with
150	liberty.
150	
150	When I take a country walk, he said, I often experience what you
150	describe.  You and I have dreamed the same thing.
150	
150	And above all, I said, and as the result of all, see how sensitive the
150	citizens become; they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority
150	and at length, as you know, they cease to care even for the laws,
150	written or unwritten; they will have no one over them.
150	
150	Yes, he said, I know it too well.
150	
150	Such, my friend, I said, is the fair and glorious beginning out of
150	which springs tyranny.
150	
150	Glorious indeed, he said.  But what is the next step?
150	
150	The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease
150	magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy--the truth
150	being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction
150	in the opposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons
150	and in vegetable and animal life, but above all in forms of government.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	The excess of liberty, whether in States or individuals, seems only to
150	pass into excess of slavery.
150	
150	Yes, the natural order.
150	
150	And so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most
150	aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of
150	liberty?
150	
150	As we might expect.
150	
150	That, however, was not, as I believe, your question-you rather desired
150	to know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and
150	democracy, and is the ruin of both?
150	
150	Just so, he replied.
150	
150	Well, I said, I meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts, of
150	whom the more courageous are the-leaders and the more timid the
150	followers, the same whom we were comparing to drones, some stingless,
150	and others having stings.
150	
150	A very just comparison.
150	
150	These two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are
150	generated, being what phlegm and bile are to the body.  And the good
150	physician and lawgiver of the State ought, like the wise bee-master, to
150	keep them at a distance and prevent, if possible, their ever coming in;
150	and if they have anyhow found a way in, then he should have them and
150	their cells cut out as speedily as possible.
150	
150	Yes, by all means, he said.
150	
150	Then, in order that we may see clearly what we are doing, let us
150	imagine democracy to be divided, as indeed it is, into three classes;
150	for in the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the
150	democratic than there were in the oligarchical State.
150	
150	That is true.
150	
150	And in the democracy they are certainly more intensified.
150	
150	How so?
150	
150	Because in the oligarchical State they are disqualified and driven from
150	office, and therefore they cannot train or gather strength; whereas in
150	a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power, and while the
150	keener sort speak and act, the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do
150	not suffer a word to be said on the other side; hence in democracies
150	almost everything is managed by the drones.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	Then there is another class which is always being severed from the mass.
150	
150	What is that?
150	
150	They are the orderly class, which in a nation of traders sure to be the
150	richest.
150	
150	Naturally so.
150	
150	They are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of
150	honey to the drones.
150	
150	Why, he said, there is little to be squeezed out of people who have
150	little.
150	
150	And this is called the wealthy class, and the drones feed upon them.
150	
150	That is pretty much the case, he said.
150	
150	The people are a third class, consisting of those who work with their
150	own hands; they are not politicians, and have not much to live upon.
150	This, when assembled, is the largest and most powerful class in a
150	democracy.
150	
150	True, he said; but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate
150	unless they get a little honey.
150	
150	And do they not share?  I said.  Do not their leaders deprive the rich
150	of their estates and distribute them among the people; at the same time
150	taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves?
150	
150	Why, yes, he said, to that extent the people do share.
150	
150	And the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to
150	defend themselves before the people as they best can?
150	
150	What else can they do?
150	
150	And then, although they may have no desire of change, the others charge
150	them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy?
150	True.
150	
150	And the end is that when they see the people, not of their own accord,
150	but through ignorance, and because they are deceived by informers,
150	seeking to do them wrong, then at last they are forced to become
150	oligarchs in reality; they do not wish to be, but the sting of the
150	drones torments them and breeds revolution in them.
150	
150	That is exactly the truth.
150	
150	Then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	The people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse
150	into greatness.
150	
150	Yes, that is their way.
150	
150	This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he
150	first appears above ground he is a protector.
150	
150	Yes, that is quite clear.
150	
150	How then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant?  Clearly when
150	he does what the man is said to do in the tale of the Arcadian temple
150	of Lycaean Zeus.
150	
150	What tale?
150	
150	The tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human
150	victim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to
150	become a wolf.  Did you never hear it?
150	
150	Oh, yes.
150	
150	And the protector of the people is like him; having a mob entirely at
150	his disposal, he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen;
150	by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court
150	and murders them, making the life of man to disappear, and with unholy
150	tongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizen; some he kills
150	and others he banishes, at the same time hinting at the abolition of
150	debts and partition of lands:  and after this, what will be his
150	destiny?  Must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies, or
150	from being a man become a wolf--that is, a tyrant?
150	
150	Inevitably.
150	
150	This, I said, is he who begins to make a party against the rich?
150	
150	The same.
150	
150	After a while he is driven out, but comes back, in spite of his
150	enemies, a tyrant full grown.
150	
150	That is clear.
150	
150	And if they are unable to expel him, or to get him condemned to death
150	by a public accusation, they conspire to assassinate him.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that is their usual way.
150	
150	Then comes the famous request for a bodyguard, which is the device of
150	all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career--'Let not
150	the people's friend,' as they say, 'be lost to them.'
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	The people readily assent; all their fears are for him--they have none
150	for themselves.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of
150	the people sees this, then, my friend, as the oracle said to Croesus,
150	
150	    By pebbly Hermus' shore he flees and rests not and is not
150	    ashamed to be a coward.
150	
150	And quite right too, said he, for if he were, he would never be ashamed
150	again.
150	
150	But if he is caught he dies.
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	And he, the protector of whom we spoke, is to be seen, not 'larding the
150	plain' with his bulk, but himself the overthrower of many, standing up
150	in the chariot of State with the reins in his hand, no longer
150	protector, but tyrant absolute.
150	
150	No doubt, he said.
150	
150	And now let us consider the happiness of the man, and also of the State
150	in which a creature like him is generated.
150	
150	Yes, he said, let us consider that.
150	
150	At first, in the early days of his power, he is full of smiles, and he
150	salutes every one whom he meets;--he to be called a tyrant, who is
150	making promises in public and also in private! liberating debtors, and
150	distributing land to the people and his followers, and wanting to be so
150	kind and good to every one!
150	
150	Of course, he said.
150	
150	But when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty, and
150	there is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some
150	war or other, in order that the people may require a leader.
150	
150	To be sure.
150	
150	Has he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished
150	by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their
150	daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him?  Clearly.
150	
150	And if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom,
150	and of resistance to his authority, he will have a good pretext for
150	destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy; and for all
150	these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war.
150	
150	He must.
150	
150	Now he begins to grow unpopular.
150	
150	A necessary result.
150	
150	Then some of those who joined in setting him up, and who are in power,
150	speak their minds to him and to one another, and the more courageous of
150	them cast in his teeth what is being done.
150	
150	Yes, that may be expected.
150	
150	And the tyrant, if he means to rule, must get rid of them; he cannot
150	stop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything.
150	
150	He cannot.
150	
150	And therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant, who is
150	high-minded, who is wise, who is wealthy; happy man, he is the enemy of
150	them all, and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no,
150	until he has made a purgation of the State.
150	
150	Yes, he said, and a rare purgation.
150	
150	Yes, I said, not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the
150	body; for they take away the worse and leave the better part, but he
150	does the reverse.
150	
150	If he is to rule, I suppose that he cannot help himself.
150	
150	What a blessed alternative, I said:--to be compelled to dwell only with
150	the many bad, and to be by them hated, or not to live at all!
150	
150	Yes, that is the alternative.
150	
150	And the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more
150	satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And who are the devoted band, and where will he procure them?
150	
150	They will flock to him, he said, of their own accord, if lie pays them.
150	
150	By the dog!  I said, here are more drones, of every sort and from every
150	land.
150	
150	Yes, he said, there are.
150	
150	But will he not desire to get them on the spot?
150	
150	How do you mean?
150	
150	He will rob the citizens of their slaves; he will then set them free
150	and enrol them in his bodyguard.
150	
150	To be sure, he said; and he will be able to trust them best of all.
150	
150	What a blessed creature, I said, must this tyrant be; he has put to
150	death the others and has these for his trusted friends.
150	
150	Yes, he said; they are quite of his sort.
150	
150	Yes, I said, and these are the new citizens whom he has called into
150	existence, who admire him and are his companions, while the good hate
150	and avoid him.
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	Verily, then, tragedy is a wise thing and Euripides a great tragedian.
150	
150	Why so?
150	
150	Why, because he is the author of the pregnant saying,
150	
150	    Tyrants are wise by living with the wise;
150	
150	and he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant
150	makes his companions.
150	
150	Yes, he said, and he also praises tyranny as godlike; and many other
150	things of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets.
150	
150	And therefore, I said, the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us
150	and any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into
150	our State, because they are the eulogists of tyranny.
150	
150	Yes, he said, those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us.
150	
150	But they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs, and hire
150	voices fair and loud and persuasive, and draw the cities over to
150	tyrannies and democracies.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Moreover, they are paid for this and receive honour--the greatest
150	honour, as might be expected, from tyrants, and the next greatest from
150	democracies; but the higher they ascend our constitution hill, the more
150	their reputation fails, and seems unable from shortness of breath to
150	proceed further.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	But we are wandering from the subject:  Let us therefore return and
150	enquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various
150	and ever-changing army of his.
150	
150	If, he said, there are sacred treasures in the city, he will confiscate
150	and spend them; and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may
150	suffice, he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise
150	have to impose upon the people.
150	
150	And when these fail?
150	
150	Why, clearly, he said, then he and his boon companions, whether male or
150	female, will be maintained out of his father's estate.
150	
150	You mean to say that the people, from whom he has derived his being,
150	will maintain him and his companions?
150	
150	Yes, he said; they cannot help themselves.
150	
150	But what if the people fly into a passion, and aver that a grown-up son
150	ought not to be supported by his father, but that the father should be
150	supported by the son?  The father did not bring him into being, or
150	settle him in life, in order that when his son became a man he should
150	himself be the servant of his own servants and should support him and
150	his rabble of slaves and companions; but that his son should protect
150	him, and that by his help he might be emancipated from the government
150	of the rich and aristocratic, as they are termed.  And so he bids him
150	and his companions depart, just as any other father might drive out of
150	the house a riotous son and his undesirable associates.
150	
150	By heaven, he said, then the parent will discover what a monster he has
150	been fostering in his bosom; and, when he wants to drive him out, he
150	will find that he is weak and his son strong.
150	
150	Why, you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence?  What!
150	beat his father if he opposes him?
150	
150	Yes, he will, having first disarmed him.
150	
150	Then he is a parricide, and a cruel guardian of an aged parent; and
150	this is real tyranny, about which there can be no longer a mistake: as
150	the saying is, the people who would escape the smoke which is the
150	slavery of freemen, has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of
150	slaves.  Thus liberty, getting out of all order and reason, passes into
150	the harshest and bitterest form of slavery.
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	Very well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently
150	discussed the nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from
150	democracy to tyranny?
150	
150	Yes, quite enough, he said.
150	
150	
150	
150	
150	BOOK IX
150	
150	
150	SOCRATES - ADEIMANTUS
150	
150	LAST of all comes the tyrannical man; about whom we have once more to
150	ask, how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he live, in
150	happiness or in misery?
150	
150	Yes, he said, he is the only one remaining.
150	
150	There is, however, I said, a previous question which remains unanswered.
150	
150	What question?
150	
150	I do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number
150	of the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will
150	always be confused.
150	
150	Well, he said, it is not too late to supply the omission.
150	
150	Very true, I said; and observe the point which I want to understand:
150	Certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites I conceive to be
150	unlawful; every one appears to have them, but in some persons they are
150	controlled by the laws and by reason, and the better desires prevail
150	over them-either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak;
150	while in the case of others they are stronger, and there are more of
150	them.
150	
150	Which appetites do you mean?
150	
150	I mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling
150	power is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or
150	drink, starts up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy his
150	desires; and there is no conceivable folly or crime--not excepting
150	incest or any other unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of
150	forbidden food--which at such a time, when he has parted company with
150	all shame and sense, a man may not be ready to commit.
150	
150	Most true, he said.
150	
150	But when a man's pulse is healthy and temperate, and when before going
150	to sleep he has awakened his rational powers, and fed them on noble
150	thoughts and enquiries, collecting himself in meditation; after having
150	first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little, but just
150	enough to lay them to sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments and
150	pains from interfering with the higher principle--which he leaves in
150	the solitude of pure abstraction, free to contemplate and aspire to the
150	knowledge of the unknown, whether in past, present, or future:  when
150	again he has allayed the passionate element, if he has a quarrel
150	against any one--I say, when, after pacifying the two irrational
150	principles, he rouses up the third, which is reason, before he takes
150	his rest, then, as you know, he attains truth most nearly, and is least
150	likely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless visions.
150	
150	I quite agree.
150	
150	In saying this I have been running into a digression; but the point
150	which I desire to note is that in all of us, even in good men, there is
150	a lawless wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep.  Pray, consider
150	whether I am right, and you agree with me.
150	
150	Yes, I agree.
150	
150	And now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic
150	man.  He was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under
150	a miserly parent, who encouraged the saving appetites in him, but
150	discountenanced the unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and
150	ornament?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And then he got into the company of a more refined, licentious sort of
150	people, and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite
150	extreme from an abhorrence of his father's meanness.  At last, being a
150	better man than his corruptors, he was drawn in both directions until
150	he halted midway and led a life, not of vulgar and slavish passion, but
150	of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures.  After this
150	manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch?
150	
150	Yes, he said; that was our view of him, and is so still.
150	
150	And now, I said, years will have passed away, and you must conceive
150	this man, such as he is, to have a son, who is brought up in his
150	father's principles.
150	
150	I can imagine him.
150	
150	Then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which
150	has already happened to the father:--he is drawn into a perfectly
150	lawless life, which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty; and his
150	father and friends take part with his moderate desires, and the
150	opposite party assist the opposite ones.  As soon as these dire
150	magicians and tyrant-makers find that they are losing their hold on
150	him, they contrive to implant in him a master passion, to be lord over
150	his idle and spendthrift lusts--a sort of monstrous winged drone--that
150	is the only image which will adequately describe him.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that is the only adequate image of him.
150	
150	And when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and
150	garlands and wines, and all the pleasures of a dissolute life, now let
150	loose, come buzzing around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting of
150	desire which they implant in his drone-like nature, then at last this
150	lord of the soul, having Madness for the captain of his guard, breaks
150	out into a frenzy:  and if he finds in himself any good opinions or
150	appetites in process of formation, and there is in him any sense of
150	shame remaining, to these better principles he puts an end, and casts
150	them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness
150	to the full.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated.
150	
150	And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?
150	
150	I should not wonder.
150	
150	Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?
150	
150	He has.
150	
150	And you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind, will
150	fancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the
150	gods?
150	
150	That he will.
150	
150	And the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being
150	when, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he
150	becomes drunken, lustful, passionate?  O my friend, is not that so?
150	
150	Assuredly.
150	
150	Such is the man and such is his origin.  And next, how does he live?
150	
150	Suppose, as people facetiously say, you were to tell me.
150	
150	I imagine, I said, at the next step in his progress, that there will be
150	feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans, and all that sort
150	of thing; Love is the lord of the house within him, and orders all the
150	concerns of his soul.
150	
150	That is certain.
150	
150	Yes; and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable,
150	and their demands are many.
150	
150	They are indeed, he said.
150	
150	His revenues, if he has any, are soon spent.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Then comes debt and the cutting down of his property.
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	When he has nothing left, must not his desires, crowding in the nest
150	like young ravens, be crying aloud for food; and he, goaded on by them,
150	and especially by love himself, who is in a manner the captain of them,
150	is in a frenzy, and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil
150	of his property, in order that he may gratify them?
150	
150	Yes, that is sure to be the case.
150	
150	He must have money, no matter how, if he is to escape horrid pains and
150	pangs.
150	
150	He must.
150	
150	And as in himself there was a succession of pleasures, and the new got
150	the better of the old and took away their rights, so he being younger
150	will claim to have more than his father and his mother, and if he has
150	spent his own share of the property, he will take a slice of theirs.
150	
150	No doubt he will.
150	
150	And if his parents will not give way, then he will try first of all to
150	cheat and deceive them.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And if he fails, then he will use force and plunder them.
150	
150	Yes, probably.
150	
150	And if the old man and woman fight for their own, what then, my friend?
150	Will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them?
150	
150	Nay, he said, I should not feel at all comfortable about his parents.
150	
150	But, O heavens!  Adeimantus, on account of some newfangled love of a
150	harlot, who is anything but a necessary connection, can you believe
150	that he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary
150	to his very existence, and would place her under the authority of the
150	other, when she is brought under the same roof with her; or that, under
150	like circumstances, he would do the same to his withered old father,
150	first and most indispensable of friends, for the sake of some newly
150	found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable?
150	
150	Yes, indeed, he said; I believe that he would.
150	
150	Truly, then, I said, a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and
150	mother.
150	
150	He is indeed, he replied.
150	
150	He first takes their property, and when that falls, and pleasures are
150	beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul, then he breaks into a
150	house, or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer; next he
150	proceeds to clear a temple.  Meanwhile the old opinions which he had
150	when a child, and which gave judgment about good and evil, are
150	overthrown by those others which have just been emancipated, and are
150	now the bodyguard of love and share his empire.  These in his
150	democratic days, when he was still subject to the laws and to his
150	father, were only let loose in the dreams of sleep.  But now that he is
150	under the dominion of love, he becomes always and in waking reality
150	what he was then very rarely and in a dream only; he will commit the
150	foulest murder, or eat forbidden food, or be guilty of any other horrid
150	act.  Love is his tyrant, and lives lordly in him and lawlessly, and
150	being himself a king, leads him on, as a tyrant leads a State, to the
150	performance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and
150	the rabble of his associates, whether those whom evil communications
150	have brought in from without, or those whom he himself has allowed to
150	break loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself.
150	Have we not here a picture of his way of life?
150	
150	Yes, indeed, he said.
150	
150	And if there are only a few of them in the State, the rest of the
150	people are well disposed, they go away and become the bodyguard or
150	mercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for
150	a war; and if there is no war, they stay at home and do many little
150	pieces of mischief in the city.
150	
150	What sort of mischief?
150	
150	For example, they are the thieves, burglars, cutpurses, footpads,
150	robbers of temples, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able
150	to speak they turn informers, and bear false witness, and take bribes.
150	
150	A small catalogue of evils, even if the perpetrators of them are few in
150	number.
150	
150	Yes, I said; but small and great are comparative terms, and all these
150	things, in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a State, do not
150	come within a thousand miles of the tyrant; when this noxious class and
150	their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength,
150	assisted by the infatuation of the people, they choose from among
150	themselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul, and him
150	they create their tyrant.
150	
150	Yes, he said, and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant.
150	
150	If the people yield, well and good; but if they resist him, as he began
150	by beating his own father and mother, so now, if he has the power, he
150	beats them, and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland, as the
150	Cretans say, in subjection to his young retainers whom he has
150	introduced to be their rulers and masters.  This is the end of his
150	passions and desires.
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	When such men are only private individuals and before they get power,
150	this is their character; they associate entirely with their own
150	flatterers or ready tools; or if they want anything from anybody, they
150	in their turn are equally ready to bow down before them: they profess
150	every sort of affection for them; but when they have gained their point
150	they know them no more.
150	
150	Yes, truly.
150	
150	They are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of
150	anybody; the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship.
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	And may we not rightly call such men treacherous?
150	
150	No question.
150	
150	Also they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of justice?
150	
150	Yes, he said, and we were perfectly right.
150	
150	Let us then sum up in a word, I said, the character of the worst man:
150	he is the waking reality of what we dreamed.
150	
150	Most true.
150	
150	And this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule, and the
150	longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes.
150	
150	SOCRATES - GLAUCON
150	
150	That is certain, said Glaucon, taking his turn to answer.
150	
150	And will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest, be also the
150	most miserable? and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most
150	continually and truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion
150	of men in general?
150	
150	Yes, he said, inevitably.
150	
150	And must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical, State, and the
150	democratical man like the democratical State; and the same of the
150	others?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And as State is to State in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation
150	to man?
150	
150	To be sure.
150	
150	Then comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the city
150	which is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?
150	
150	They are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best and
150	the other is the very worst.
150	
150	There can be no mistake, I said, as to which is which, and therefore I
150	will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision
150	about their relative happiness and misery.  And here we must not allow
150	ourselves to be panic-stricken at the apparition of the tyrant, who is
150	only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him; but let us
150	go as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about, and
150	then we will give our opinion.
150	
150	A fair invitation, he replied; and I see, as every one must, that a
150	tyranny is the wretchedest form of government, and the rule of a king
150	the happiest.
150	
150	And in estimating the men too, may I not fairly make a like request,
150	that I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through
150	human nature?  He must not be like a child who looks at the outside and
150	is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to
150	the beholder, but let him be one who has a clear insight.  May I
150	suppose that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who
150	is able to judge, and has dwelt in the same place with him, and been
150	present at his dally life and known him in his family relations, where
150	he may be seen stripped of his tragedy attire, and again in the hour of
150	public danger--he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the
150	tyrant when compared with other men?
150	
150	That again, he said, is a very fair proposal.
150	
150	Shall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and
150	have before now met with such a person?  We shall then have some one
150	who will answer our enquiries.
150	
150	By all means.
150	
150	Let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the
150	State; bearing this in mind, and glancing in turn from one to the other
150	of them, will you tell me their respective conditions?
150	
150	What do you mean? he asked.
150	
150	Beginning with the State, I replied, would you say that a city which is
150	governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved?
150	
150	No city, he said, can be more completely enslaved.
150	
150	And yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such a
150	State?
150	
150	Yes, he said, I see that there are--a few; but the people, speaking
150	generally, and the best of them, are miserably degraded and enslaved.
150	
150	Then if the man is like the State, I said, must not the same rule
150	prevail? his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity--the best elements
150	in him are enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also
150	the worst and maddest.
150	
150	Inevitably.
150	
150	And would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a
150	freeman, or of a slave?
150	
150	He has the soul of a slave, in my opinion.
150	
150	And the State which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of
150	acting voluntarily?
150	
150	Utterly incapable.
150	
150	And also the soul which is under a tyrant (I am speaking of the soul
150	taken as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there is
150	a gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?
150	
150	Poor.
150	
150	And the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And must not such a State and such a man be always full of fear?
150	
150	Yes, indeed.
150	
150	Is there any State in which you will find more of lamentation and
150	sorrow and groaning and pain?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	And is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery
150	than in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and desires?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	Reflecting upon these and similar evils, you held the tyrannical State
150	to be the most miserable of States?
150	
150	And I was right, he said.
150	
150	Certainly, I said.  And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical
150	man, what do you say of him?
150	
150	I say that he is by far the most miserable of all men.
150	
150	There, I said, I think that you are beginning to go wrong.
150	
150	What do you mean?
150	
150	I do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery.
150	
150	Then who is more miserable?
150	
150	One of whom I am about to speak.
150	
150	Who is that?
150	
150	He who is of a tyrannical nature, and instead of leading a private life
150	has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant.
150	
150	From what has been said, I gather that you are right.
150	
150	Yes, I replied, but in this high argument you should be a little more
150	certain, and should not conjecture only; for of all questions, this
150	respecting good and evil is the greatest.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	Let me then offer you an illustration, which may, I think, throw a
150	light upon this subject.
150	
150	What is your illustration?
150	
150	The case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from
150	them you may form an idea of the tyrant's condition, for they both have
150	slaves; the only difference is that he has more slaves.
150	
150	Yes, that is the difference.
150	
150	You know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from
150	their servants?
150	
150	What should they fear?
150	
150	Nothing.  But do you observe the reason of this?
150	
150	Yes; the reason is, that the whole city is leagued together for the
150	protection of each individual.
150	
150	Very true, I said.  But imagine one of these owners, the master say of
150	some fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves,
150	carried off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to
150	help him--will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and
150	children should be put to death by his slaves?
150	
150	Yes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear.
150	
150	The time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his
150	slaves, and make many promises to them of freedom and other things,
150	much against his will--he will have to cajole his own servants.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that will be the only way of saving himself.
150	
150	And suppose the same god, who carried him away, to surround him with
150	neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another, and
150	who, if they could catch the offender, would take his life?
150	
150	His case will be still worse, if you suppose him to be everywhere
150	surrounded and watched by enemies.
150	
150	And is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be
150	bound--he who being by nature such as we have described, is full of all
150	sorts of fears and lusts?  His soul is dainty and greedy, and yet
150	alone, of all men in the city, he is never allowed to go on a journey,
150	or to see the things which other freemen desire to see, but he lives in
150	his hole like a woman hidden in the house, and is jealous of any other
150	citizen who goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	And amid evils such as these will not he who is ill-governed in his own
150	person--the tyrannical man, I mean--whom you just now decided to be the
150	most miserable of all--will not he be yet more miserable when, instead
150	of leading a private life, he is constrained by fortune to be a public
150	tyrant?  He has to be master of others when he is not master of
150	himself: he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to
150	pass his life, not in retirement, but fighting and combating with other
150	men.
150	
150	Yes, he said, the similitude is most exact.
150	
150	Is not his case utterly miserable? and does not the actual tyrant lead
150	a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	He who is the real tyrant, whatever men may think, is the real slave,
150	and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility, and to
150	be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind.  He has desires which he is
150	utterly unable to satisfy, and has more wants than any one, and is
150	truly poor, if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him: all his
150	life long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions, and
150	distractions, even as the State which he resembles: and surely the
150	resemblance holds?
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	Moreover, as we were saying before, he grows worse from having power:
150	he becomes and is of necessity more jealous, more faithless, more
150	unjust, more friendless, more impious, than he was at first; he is the
150	purveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice, and the consequence is
150	that he is supremely miserable, and that he makes everybody else as
150	miserable as himself.
150	
150	No man of any sense will dispute your words.
150	
150	Come then, I said, and as the general umpire in theatrical contests
150	proclaims the result, do you also decide who in your opinion is first
150	in the scale of happiness, and who second, and in what order the others
150	follow:  there are five of them in all--they are the royal,
150	timocratical, oligarchical, democratical, tyrannical.
150	
150	The decision will be easily given, he replied; they shall be choruses
150	coming on the stage, and I must judge them in the order in which they
150	enter, by the criterion of virtue and vice, happiness and misery.
150	
150	Need we hire a herald, or shall I announce, that the son of Ariston
150	(the best) has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest,
150	and that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself;
150	and that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable, and
150	that this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the
150	greatest tyrant of his State?
150	
150	Make the proclamation yourself, he said.
150	
150	And shall I add, 'whether seen or unseen by gods and men'?
150	
150	Let the words be added.
150	
150	Then this, I said, will be our first proof; and there is another, which
150	may also have some weight.
150	
150	What is that?
150	
150	The second proof is derived from the nature of the soul: seeing that
150	the individual soul, like the State, has been divided by us into three
150	principles, the division may, I think, furnish a new demonstration.
150	
150	Of what nature?
150	
150	It seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures
150	correspond; also three desires and governing powers.
150	
150	How do you mean? he said.
150	
150	There is one principle with which, as we were saying, a man learns,
150	another with which he is angry; the third, having many forms, has no
150	special name, but is denoted by the general term appetitive, from the
150	extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and
150	drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of
150	it; also money-loving, because such desires are generally satisfied by
150	the help of money.
150	
150	That is true, he said.
150	
150	If we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were
150	concerned with gain, we should then be able to fall back on a single
150	notion; and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul
150	as loving gain or money.
150	
150	I agree with you.
150	
150	Again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and
150	conquering and getting fame?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious--would the term be
150	suitable?
150	
150	Extremely suitable.
150	
150	On the other hand, every one sees that the principle of knowledge is
150	wholly directed to the truth, and cares less than either of the others
150	for gain or fame.
150	
150	Far less.
150	
150	'Lover of wisdom,' 'lover of knowledge,' are titles which we may fitly
150	apply to that part of the soul?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	One principle prevails in the souls of one class of men, another in
150	others, as may happen?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of
150	men--lovers of wisdom, lovers of honour, lovers of gain?
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	And there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their several objects?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Now, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in turn
150	which of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his
150	own and depreciating that of others:  the money-maker will contrast the
150	vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid
150	advantages of gold and silver?
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	And the lover of honour--what will be his opinion?  Will he not think
150	that the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning,
150	if it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And are we to suppose, I said, that the philosopher sets any value on
150	other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth,
150	and in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed from the
150	heaven of pleasure?  Does he not call the other pleasures necessary,
150	under the idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would
150	rather not have them?
150	
150	There can be no doubt of that, he replied.
150	
150	Since, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in
150	dispute, and the question is not which life is more or less honourable,
150	or better or worse, but which is the more pleasant or painless--how
150	shall we know who speaks truly?
150	
150	I cannot myself tell, he said.
150	
150	Well, but what ought to be the criterion?  Is any better than
150	experience and wisdom and reason?
150	
150	There cannot be a better, he said.
150	
150	Then, I said, reflect.  Of the three individuals, which has the
150	greatest experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated?  Has the
150	lover of gain, in learning the nature of essential truth, greater
150	experience of the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the
150	pleasure of gain?
150	
150	The philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he has of
150	necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his
150	childhood upwards:  but the lover of gain in all his experience has not
150	of necessity tasted--or, I should rather say, even had he desired,
150	could hardly have tasted--the sweetness of learning and knowing truth.
150	
150	Then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain,
150	for he has a double experience?
150	
150	Yes, very great.
150	
150	Again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the
150	lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?
150	
150	Nay, he said, all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their
150	object; for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have
150	their crowd of admirers, and as they all receive honour they all have
150	experience of the pleasures of honour; but the delight which is to be
150	found in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only.
150	
150	His experience, then, will enable him to judge better than any one?
150	
150	Far better.
150	
150	And he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Further, the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not
150	possessed by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the philosopher?
150	
150	What faculty?
150	
150	Reason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to rest.
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	If wealth and gain were the criterion, then the praise or blame of the
150	lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy?
150	
150	Assuredly.
150	
150	Or if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgement of the
150	ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	But since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges--
150	
150	The only inference possible, he replied, is that pleasures which are
150	approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.
150	
150	And so we arrive at the result, that the pleasure of the intelligent
150	part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three, and that he of us in
150	whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life.
150	
150	Unquestionably, he said, the wise man speaks with authority when he
150	approves of his own life.
150	
150	And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the
150	pleasure which is next?
150	
150	Clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour; who is nearer to
150	himself than the money-maker.
150	
150	Last comes the lover of gain?
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	Twice in succession, then, has the just man overthrown the unjust in
150	this conflict; and now comes the third trial, which is dedicated to
150	Olympian Zeus the saviour:  a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure
150	except that of the wise is quite true and pure--all others are a shadow
150	only; and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of
150	falls?
150	
150	Yes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?
150	
150	I will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions.
150	
150	Proceed.
150	
150	Say, then, is not pleasure opposed to pain?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain?
150	
150	There is.
150	
150	A state which is intermediate, and a sort of repose of the soul about
150	either--that is what you mean?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	You remember what people say when they are sick?
150	
150	What do they say?
150	
150	That after all nothing is pleasanter than health.  But then they never
150	knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill.
150	
150	Yes, I know, he said.
150	
150	And when persons are suffering from acute pain, you must.  have heard
150	them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?
150	
150	I have.
150	
150	And there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and
150	cessation of pain, and not any positive enjoyment, is extolled by them
150	as the greatest pleasure?
150	
150	Yes, he said; at the time they are pleased and well content to be at
150	rest.
150	
150	Again, when pleasure ceases, that sort of rest or cessation will be
150	painful?
150	
150	Doubtless, he said.
150	
150	Then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be
150	pain?
150	
150	So it would seem.
150	
150	But can that which is neither become both?
150	
150	I should say not.
150	
150	And both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul, are they not?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	But that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion,
150	and in a mean between them?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	How, then, can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is
150	pleasure, or that the absence of pleasure is pain?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	This then is an appearance only and not a reality; that is to say, the
150	rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful,
150	and painful in comparison of what is pleasant; but all these
150	representations, when tried by the test of true pleasure, are not real
150	but a sort of imposition?
150	
150	That is the inference.
150	
150	Look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and
150	you will no longer suppose, as you perhaps may at present, that
150	pleasure is only the cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.
150	
150	What are they, he said, and where shall I find them?
150	
150	There are many of them:  take as an example the pleasures, of smell,
150	which are very great and have no antecedent pains; they come in a
150	moment, and when they depart leave no pain behind them.
150	
150	Most true, he said.
150	
150	Let us not, then, be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the
150	cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.
150	
150	No.
150	
150	Still, the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul
150	through the body are generally of this sort--they are reliefs of pain.
150	
150	That is true.
150	
150	And the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like
150	nature?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Shall I give you an illustration of them?
150	
150	Let me hear.
150	
150	You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and
150	middle region?
150	
150	I should.
150	
150	And if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region, would
150	he not imagine that he is going up; and he who is standing in the
150	middle and sees whence he has come, would imagine that he is already in
150	the upper region, if he has never seen the true upper world?
150	
150	To be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise?
150	
150	But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine,
150	that he was descending?
150	
150	No doubt.
150	
150	All that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle
150	and lower regions?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth, as
150	they have wrong ideas about many other things, should also have wrong
150	ideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state; so that when
150	they are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think
150	the pain which they experience to be real, and in like manner, when
150	drawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state, they firmly
150	believe that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure; they,
150	not knowing pleasure, err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain,
150	which is like contrasting black with grey instead of white--can you
150	wonder, I say, at this?
150	
150	No, indeed; I should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite.
150	
150	Look at the matter thus:--Hunger, thirst, and the like, are inanitions
150	of the bodily state?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that
150	which has more existence the truer?
150	
150	Clearly, from that which has more.
150	
150	What classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your
150	judgment--those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of
150	sustenance are examples, or the class which contains true opinion and
150	knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue?  Put the
150	question in this way:--Which has a more pure being--that which is
150	concerned with the invariable, the immortal, and the true, and is of
150	such a nature, and is found in such natures; or that which is concerned
150	with and found in the variable and mortal, and is itself variable and
150	mortal?
150	
150	Far purer, he replied, is the being of that which is concerned with the
150	invariable.
150	
150	And does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same
150	degree as of essence?
150	
150	Yes, of knowledge in the same degree.
150	
150	And of truth in the same degree?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of
150	essence?
150	
150	Necessarily.
150	
150	Then, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of the
150	body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service
150	of the soul?
150	
150	Far less.
150	
150	And has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	What is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real
150	existence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less
150	real existence and is less real?
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	And if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according
150	to nature, that which is more really filled with more real being will
150	more really and truly enjoy true pleasure; whereas that which
150	participates in less real being will be less truly and surely
150	satisfied, and will participate in an illusory and less real pleasure?
150	
150	Unquestionably.
150	
150	Those then who know not wisdom and virtue, and are always busy with
150	gluttony and sensuality, go down and up again as far as the mean; and
150	in this region they move at random throughout life, but they never pass
150	into the true upper world; thither they neither look, nor do they ever
150	find their way, neither are they truly filled with true being, nor do
150	they taste of pure and abiding pleasure.  Like cattle, with their eyes
150	always looking down and their heads stooping to the earth, that is, to
150	the dining-table, they fatten and feed and breed, and, in their
150	excessive love of these delights, they kick and butt at one another
150	with horns and hoofs which are made of iron; and they kill one another
150	by reason of their insatiable lust.  For they fill themselves with that
150	which is not substantial, and the part of themselves which they fill is
150	also unsubstantial and incontinent.
150	
150	Verily, Socrates, said Glaucon, you describe the life of the many like
150	an oracle.
150	
150	Their pleasures are mixed with pains--how can they be otherwise?  For
150	they are mere shadows and pictures of the true, and are coloured by
150	contrast, which exaggerates both light and shade, and so they implant
150	in the minds of fools insane desires of themselves; and they are fought
150	about as Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about the shadow of
150	Helen at Troy in ignorance of the truth.
150	
150	Something of that sort must inevitably happen.
150	
150	And must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of
150	the soul?  Will not the passionate man who carries his passion into
150	action, be in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or
150	violent and contentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking to
150	attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without
150	reason or sense?
150	
150	Yes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element also.
150	
150	Then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour,
150	when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of
150	reason and knowledge, and pursue after and win the pleasures which
150	wisdom shows them, will also have the truest pleasures in the highest
150	degree which is attainable to them, inasmuch as they follow truth; and
150	they will have the pleasures which are natural to them, if that which
150	is best for each one is also most natural to him?
150	
150	Yes, certainly; the best is the most natural.
150	
150	And when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle, and there
150	is no division, the several parts are just, and do each of them their
150	own business, and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of
150	which they are capable?
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	But when either of the two other principles prevails, it fails in
150	attaining its own pleasure, and compels the rest to pursue after a
150	pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and
150	reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance
150	from law and order?
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	And the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest
150	distance?  Yes.
150	
150	And the royal and orderly desires are nearest?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural
150	pleasure, and the king at the least?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	But if so, the tyrant will live most unpleasantly, and the king most
150	pleasantly?
150	
150	Inevitably.
150	
150	Would you know the measure of the interval which separates them?
150	
150	Will you tell me?
150	
150	There appear to be three pleasures, one genuine and two spurious: now
150	the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious; he
150	has run away from the region of law and reason, and taken up his abode
150	with certain slave pleasures which are his satellites, and the measure
150	of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure.
150	
150	How do you mean?
150	
150	I assume, I said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the
150	oligarch; the democrat was in the middle?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an
150	image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure
150	of the oligarch?
150	
150	He will.
150	
150	And the oligarch is third from the royal; since we count as one royal
150	and aristocratical?
150	
150	Yes, he is third.
150	
150	Then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number
150	which is three times three?
150	
150	Manifestly.
150	
150	The shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of
150	length will be a plane figure.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And if you raise the power and make the plane a solid, there is no
150	difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is
150	parted from the king.
150	
150	Yes; the arithmetician will easily do the sum.
150	
150	Or if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval by
150	which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure, he will
150	find him, when the multiplication is complete, living 729 times more
150	pleasantly, and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval.
150	
150	What a wonderful calculation!  And how enormous is the distance which
150	separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain!
150	
150	Yet a true calculation, I said, and a number which nearly concerns
150	human life, if human beings are concerned with days and nights and
150	months and years.
150	
150	Yes, he said, human life is certainly concerned with them.
150	
150	Then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil
150	and unjust, his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of
150	life and in beauty and virtue?
150	
150	Immeasurably greater.
150	
150	Well, I said, and now having arrived at this stage of the argument, we
150	may revert to the words which brought us hither:  Was not some one
150	saying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was
150	reputed to be just?
150	
150	Yes, that was said.
150	
150	Now then, having determined the power and quality of justice and
150	injustice, let us have a little conversation with him.
150	
150	What shall we say to him?
150	
150	Let us make an image of the soul, that he may have his own words
150	presented before his eyes.
150	
150	Of what sort?
150	
150	An ideal image of the soul, like the composite creations of ancient
150	mythology, such as the Chimera or Scylla or Cerberus, and there are
150	many others in which two or more different natures are said to grow
150	into one.
150	
150	There are said of have been such unions.
150	
150	Then do you now model the form of a multitudinous, many-headed monster,
150	having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts, tame and wild, which he
150	is able to generate and metamorphose at will.
150	
150	You suppose marvellous powers in the artist; but, as language is more
150	pliable than wax or any similar substance, let there be such a model as
150	you propose.
150	
150	Suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion, and a third of a
150	man, the second smaller than the first, and the third smaller than the
150	second.
150	
150	That, he said, is an easier task; and I have made them as you say.
150	
150	And now join them, and let the three grow into one.
150	
150	That has been accomplished.
150	
150	Next fashion the outside of them into a single image, as of a man, so
150	that he who is not able to look within, and sees only the outer hull,
150	may believe the beast to be a single human creature.  I have done so,
150	he said.
150	
150	And now, to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human
150	creature to be unjust, and unprofitable to be just, let us reply that,
150	if he be right, it is profitable for this creature to feast the
150	multitudinous monster and strengthen the lion and the lion-like
150	qualities, but to starve and weaken the man, who is consequently liable
150	to be dragged about at the mercy of either of the other two; and he is
150	not to attempt to familiarize or harmonize them with one another--he
150	ought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one another.
150	
150	Certainly, he said; that is what the approver of injustice says.
150	
150	To him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so
150	speak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the
150	most complete mastery over the entire human creature.
150	
150	He should watch over the many-headed monster like a good husbandman,
150	fostering and cultivating the gentle qualities, and preventing the wild
150	ones from growing; he should be making the lion-heart his ally, and in
150	common care of them all should be uniting the several parts with one
150	another and with himself.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that is quite what the maintainer of justice say.
150	
150	And so from every point of view, whether of pleasure, honour, or
150	advantage, the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth, and
150	the disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant.
150	
150	Yes, from every point of view.
150	
150	Come, now, and let us gently reason with the unjust, who is not
150	intentionally in error.  'Sweet Sir,' we will say to him, what think
150	you of things esteemed noble and ignoble?  Is not the noble that which
150	subjects the beast to the man, or rather to the god in man; and the
150	ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast?' He can hardly avoid
150	saying yes--can he now?
150	
150	Not if he has any regard for my opinion.
150	
150	But, if he agree so far, we may ask him to answer another question:
150	'Then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the
150	condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst?
150	Who can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery
150	for money, especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil
150	men, would be the gainer, however large might be the sum which he
150	received?  And will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who
150	remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless
150	and detestable?  Eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her
150	husband's life, but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse
150	ruin.'
150	
150	Yes, said Glaucon, far worse--I will answer for him.
150	
150	Has not the intemperate been censured of old, because in him the huge
150	multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large?
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	And men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent
150	element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken this
150	same creature, and make a coward of him?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates
150	the spirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of money,
150	of which he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his
150	youth to be trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become a
150	monkey?
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	And why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach Only because
150	they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle; the individual
150	is unable to control the creatures within him, but has to court them,
150	and his great study is how to flatter them.
150	
150	Such appears to be the reason.
150	
150	And therefore, being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of
150	the best, we say that he ought to be the servant of the best, in whom
150	the Divine rules; not, as Thrasymachus supposed, to the injury of the
150	servant, but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom
150	dwelling within him; or, if this be impossible, then by an external
150	authority, in order that we may be all, as far as possible, under the
150	same government, friends and equals.
150	
150	True, he said.
150	
150	And this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law, which is the
150	ally of the whole city; and is seen also in the authority which we
150	exercise over children, and the refusal to let them be free until we
150	have established in them a principle analogous to the constitution of a
150	state, and by cultivation of this higher element have set up in their
150	hearts a guardian and ruler like our own, and when this is done they
150	may go their ways.
150	
150	Yes, he said, the purpose of the law is manifest.
150	
150	From what point of view, then, and on what ground can we say that a man
150	is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness, which will
150	make him a worse man, even though he acquire money or power by his
150	wickedness?
150	
150	From no point of view at all.
150	
150	What shall he profit, if his injustice be undetected and unpunished?
150	He who is undetected only gets worse, whereas he who is detected and
150	punished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized; the
150	gentler element in him is liberated, and his whole soul is perfected
150	and ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom,
150	more than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty, strength and
150	health, in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body.
150	
150	Certainly, he said.
150	
150	To this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the
150	energies of his life.  And in the first place, he will honour studies
150	which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others?
150	
150	Clearly, he said.
150	
150	In the next place, he will regulate his bodily habit and training, and
150	so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures,
150	that he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter; his first
150	object will be not that he may be fair or strong or well, unless he is
150	likely thereby to gain temperance, but he will always desire so to
150	attemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul?
150	
150	Certainly he will, if he has true music in him.
150	
150	And in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and
150	harmony which he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be
150	dazzled by the foolish applause of the world, and heap up riches to his
150	own infinite harm?
150	
150	Certainly not, he said.
150	
150	He will look at the city which is within him, and take heed that no
150	disorder occur in it, such as might arise either from superfluity or
150	from want; and upon this principle he will regulate his property and
150	gain or spend according to his means.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours
150	as he deems likely to make him a better man; but those, whether private
150	or public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will avoid?
150	
150	Then, if that is his motive, he will not be a statesman.
150	
150	By the dog of Egypt, he will! in the city which is his own he certainly
150	will, though in the land of his birth perhaps not, unless he have a
150	divine call.
150	
150	I understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we
150	are the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believe
150	that there is such an one anywhere on earth?
150	
150	In heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks, which
150	he who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house in
150	order.  But whether such an one exists, or ever will exist in fact, is
150	no matter; for he will live after the manner of that city, having
150	nothing to do with any other.
150	
150	I think so, he said.
150

150	
150	BOOK X
150	
150	
150	SOCRATES - GLAUCON
150	
150	OF THE many excellences which I perceive in the order of our State,
150	there is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule
150	about poetry.
150	
150	To what do you refer?
150	
150	To the rejection of imitative poetry, which certainly ought not to be
150	received; as I see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have
150	been distinguished.
150	
150	What do you mean?
150	
150	Speaking in confidence, for I should not like to have my words repeated
150	to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe--but I do not
150	mind saying to you, that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the
150	understanding of the hearers, and that the knowledge of their true
150	nature is the only antidote to them.
150	
150	Explain the purport of your remark.
150	
150	Well, I will tell you, although I have always from my earliest youth
150	had an awe and love of Homer, which even now makes the words falter on
150	my lips, for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that
150	charming tragic company; but a man is not to be reverenced more than
150	the truth, and therefore I will speak out.
150	
150	Very good, he said.
150	
150	Listen to me then, or rather, answer me.
150	
150	Put your question.
150	
150	Can you tell me what imitation is? for I really do not know.
150	
150	A likely thing, then, that I should know.
150	
150	Why not? for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the
150	keener.
150	
150	Very true, he said; but in your presence, even if I had any faint
150	notion, I could not muster courage to utter it.  Will you enquire
150	yourself?
150	
150	Well then, shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner: Whenever a
150	number of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also a
150	corresponding idea or form.  Do you understand me?
150	
150	I do.
150	
150	Let us take any common instance; there are beds and tables in the
150	world--plenty of them, are there not?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	But there are only two ideas or forms of them--one the idea of a bed,
150	the other of a table.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our
150	use, in accordance with the idea--that is our way of speaking in this
150	and similar instances--but no artificer makes the ideas themselves: how
150	could he?
150	
150	Impossible.
150	
150	And there is another artist,--I should like to know what you would say
150	of him.
150	
150	Who is he?
150	
150	One who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen.
150	
150	What an extraordinary man!
150	
150	Wait a little, and there will be more reason for your saying so.  For
150	this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind, but
150	plants and animals, himself and all other things--the earth and heaven,
150	and the things which are in heaven or under the earth; he makes the
150	gods also.
150	
150	He must be a wizard and no mistake.
150	
150	Oh! you are incredulous, are you?  Do you mean that there is no such
150	maker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all
150	these things but in another not?  Do you see that there is a way in
150	which you could make them all yourself?
150	
150	What way?
150	
150	An easy way enough; or rather, there are many ways in which the feat
150	might be quickly and easily accomplished, none quicker than that of
150	turning a mirror round and round--you would soon enough make the sun
150	and the heavens, and the earth and yourself, and other animals and
150	plants, and all the other things of which we were just now speaking, in
150	the mirror.
150	
150	Yes, he said; but they would be appearances only.
150	
150	Very good, I said, you are coming to the point now.  And the painter
150	too is, as I conceive, just such another--a creator of appearances, is
150	he not?
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	But then I suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue.  And
150	yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed?
150	
150	Yes, he said, but not a real bed.
150	
150	And what of the maker of the bed?  Were you not saying that he too
150	makes, not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the
150	bed, but only a particular bed?
150	
150	Yes, I did.
150	
150	Then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true
150	existence, but only some semblance of existence; and if any one were to
150	say that the work of the maker of the bed, or of any other workman, has
150	real existence, he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth.
150	
150	At any rate, he replied, philosophers would say that he was not
150	speaking the truth.
150	
150	No wonder, then, that his work too is an indistinct expression of truth.
150	
150	No wonder.
150	
150	Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire
150	who this imitator is?
150	
150	If you please.
150	
150	Well then, here are three beds:  one existing in nature, which is made
150	by God, as I think that we may say--for no one else can be the maker?
150	
150	No.
150	
150	There is another which is the work of the carpenter?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And the work of the painter is a third?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Beds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who
150	superintend them:  God, the maker of the bed, and the painter?
150	
150	Yes, there are three of them.
150	
150	God, whether from choice or from necessity, made one bed in nature and
150	one only; two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever
150	will be made by God.
150	
150	Why is that?
150	
150	Because even if He had made but two, a third would still appear behind
150	them which both of them would have for their idea, and that would be
150	the ideal bed and the two others.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	God knew this, and He desired to be the real maker of a real bed, not a
150	particular maker of a particular bed, and therefore He created a bed
150	which is essentially and by nature one only.
150	
150	So we believe.
150	
150	Shall we, then, speak of Him as the natural author or maker of the bed?
150	
150	Yes, he replied; inasmuch as by the natural process of creation He is
150	the author of this and of all other things.
150	
150	And what shall we say of the carpenter--is not he also the maker of the
150	bed?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	But would you call the painter a creator and maker?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?
150	
150	I think, he said, that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of
150	that which the others make.
150	
150	Good, I said; then you call him who is third in the descent from nature
150	an imitator?
150	
150	Certainly, he said.
150	
150	And the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other
150	imitators, he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth?
150	
150	That appears to be so.
150	
150	Then about the imitator we are agreed.  And what about the painter?-- I
150	would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which
150	originally exists in nature, or only the creations of artists?
150	
150	The latter.
150	
150	As they are or as they appear?  You have still to determine this.
150	
150	What do you mean?
150	
150	I mean, that you may look at a bed from different points of view,
150	obliquely or directly or from any other point of view, and the bed will
150	appear different, but there is no difference in reality.  And the same
150	of all things.
150	
150	Yes, he said, the difference is only apparent.
150	
150	Now let me ask you another question:  Which is the art of painting
150	designed to be--an imitation of things as they are, or as they
150	appear--of appearance or of reality?
150	
150	Of appearance.
150	
150	Then the imitator, I said, is a long way off the truth, and can do all
150	things because he lightly touches on a small part of them, and that
150	part an image.  For example:  A painter will paint a cobbler,
150	carpenter, or any other artist, though he knows nothing of their arts;
150	and, if he is a good artist, he may deceive children or simple persons,
150	when he shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance, and they
150	will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man knows all the
150	arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing
150	with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man--whoever tells us
150	this, I think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is
150	likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and
150	whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyse
150	the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.
150	
150	Most true.
150	
150	And so, when we hear persons saying that the tragedians, and Homer, who
150	is at their head, know all the arts and all things human, virtue as
150	well as vice, and divine things too, for that the good poet cannot
150	compose well unless he knows his subject, and that he who has not this
150	knowledge can never be a poet, we ought to consider whether here also
150	there may not be a similar illusion.  Perhaps they may have come across
150	imitators and been deceived by them; they may not have remembered when
150	they saw their works that these were but imitations thrice removed from
150	the truth, and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth,
150	because they are appearances only and not realities?  Or, after all,
150	they may be in the right, and poets do really know the things about
150	which they seem to the many to speak so well?
150	
150	The question, he said, should by all means be considered.
150	
150	Now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as
150	well as the image, he would seriously devote himself to the
150	image-making branch?  Would he allow imitation to be the ruling
150	principle of his life, as if he had nothing higher in him?
150	
150	I should say not.
150	
150	The real artist, who knew what he was imitating, would be interested in
150	realities and not in imitations; and would desire to leave as memorials
150	of himself works many and fair; and, instead of being the author of
150	encomiums, he would prefer to be the theme of them.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that would be to him a source of much greater honour and
150	profit.
150	
150	Then, I said, we must put a question to Homer; not about medicine, or
150	any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer: we are not
150	going to ask him, or any other poet, whether he has cured patients like
150	Asclepius, or left behind him a school of medicine such as the
150	Asclepiads were, or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts
150	at second hand; but we have a right to know respecting military
150	tactics, politics, education, which are the chiefest and noblest
150	subjects of his poems, and we may fairly ask him about them.  'Friend
150	Homer,' then we say to him, 'if you are only in the second remove from
150	truth in what you say of virtue, and not in the third--not an image
150	maker or imitator--and if you are able to discern what pursuits make
150	men better or worse in private or public life, tell us what State was
150	ever better governed by your help?  The good order of Lacedaemon is due
150	to Lycurgus, and many other cities great and small have been similarly
150	benefited by others; but who says that you have been a good legislator
150	to them and have done them any good?  Italy and Sicily boast of
150	Charondas, and there is Solon who is renowned among us; but what city
150	has anything to say about you?'  Is there any city which he might name?
150	
150	I think not, said Glaucon; not even the Homerids themselves pretend
150	that he was a legislator.
150	
150	Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully
150	by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?
150	
150	There is not.
150	
150	Or is there any invention of his, applicable to the arts or to human
150	life, such as Thales the Milesian or Anacharsis the Scythian, and other
150	ingenious men have conceived, which is attributed to him?
150	
150	There is absolutely nothing of the kind.
150	
150	But, if Homer never did any public service, was he privately a guide or
150	teacher of any?  Had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate
150	with him, and who handed down to posterity an Homeric way of life, such
150	as was established by Pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his
150	wisdom, and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the
150	order which was named after him?
150	
150	Nothing of the kind is recorded of him.  For surely, Socrates,
150	Creophylus, the companion of Homer, that child of flesh, whose name
150	always makes us laugh, might be more justly ridiculed for his
150	stupidity, if, as is said, Homer was greatly neglected by him and
150	others in his own day when he was alive?
150	
150	Yes, I replied, that is the tradition.  But can you imagine, Glaucon,
150	that if Homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind--if
150	he had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator--can you
150	imagine, I say, that he would not have had many followers, and been
150	honoured and loved by them?  Protagoras of Abdera, and Prodicus of
150	Ceos, and a host of others, have only to whisper to their
150	contemporaries: 'You will never be able to manage either your own house
150	or your own State until you appoint us to be your ministers of
150	education'--and this ingenious device of theirs has such an effect in
150	making them love them that their companions all but carry them about on
150	their shoulders.  And is it conceivable that the contemporaries of
150	Homer, or again of Hesiod, would have allowed either of them to go
150	about as rhapsodists, if they had really been able to make mankind
150	virtuous?  Would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as
150	with gold, and have compelled them to stay at home with them?  Or, if
150	the master would not stay, then the disciples would have followed him
150	about everywhere, until they had got education enough?
150	
150	Yes, Socrates, that, I think, is quite true.
150	
150	Then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning
150	with Homer, are only imitators; they copy images of virtue and the
150	like, but the truth they never reach?  The poet is like a painter who,
150	as we have already observed, will make a likeness of a cobbler though
150	he understands nothing of cobbling; and his picture is good enough for
150	those who know no more than he does, and judge only by colours and
150	figures.
150	
150	Quite so.
150	
150	In like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay
150	on the colours of the several arts, himself understanding their nature
150	only enough to imitate them; and other people, who are as ignorant as
150	he is, and judge only from his words, imagine that if he speaks of
150	cobbling, or of military tactics, or of anything else, in metre and
150	harmony and rhythm, he speaks very well--such is the sweet influence
150	which melody and rhythm by nature have.  And I think that you must have
150	observed again and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make
150	when stripped of the colours which music puts upon them, and recited in
150	simple prose.
150	
150	Yes, he said.
150	
150	They are like faces which were never really beautiful, but only
150	blooming; and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them?
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	Here is another point:  The imitator or maker of the image knows
150	nothing of true existence; he knows appearances only.  Am I not right?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Then let us have a clear understanding, and not be satisfied with half
150	an explanation.
150	
150	Proceed.
150	
150	Of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And the worker in leather and brass will make them?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	But does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins?  Nay,
150	hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the
150	horseman who knows how to use them--he knows their right form.
150	
150	Most true.
150	
150	And may we not say the same of all things?
150	
150	What?
150	
150	That there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one
150	which uses, another which makes, a third which imitates them?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure, animate or
150	inanimate, and of every action of man, is relative to the use for which
150	nature or the artist has intended them.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	Then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them, and he
150	must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop
150	themselves in use; for example, the flute-player will tell the
150	flute-maker which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer; he
150	will tell him how he ought to make them, and the other will attend to
150	his instructions?
150	
150	Of course.
150	
150	The one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness
150	and badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what
150	he is told by him?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	The instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of it
150	the maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain
150	from him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to hear what
150	he has to say, whereas the user will have knowledge?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	But will the imitator have either?  Will he know from use whether or no
150	his drawing is correct or beautiful?  Or will he have right opinion
150	from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him
150	instructions about what he should draw?
150	
150	Neither.
150	
150	Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge
150	about the goodness or badness of his imitations?
150	
150	I suppose not.
150	
150	The imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about
150	his own creations?
150	
150	Nay, very much the reverse.
150	
150	And still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing
150	good or bad, and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which
150	appears to be good to the ignorant multitude?
150	
150	Just so.
150	
150	Thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no
150	knowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates.  Imitation is only a
150	kind of play or sport, and the tragic poets, whether they write in
150	iambic or in Heroic verse, are imitators in the highest degree?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us to
150	be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?
150	
150	What do you mean?
150	
150	I will explain:  The body which is large when seen near, appears small
150	when seen at a distance?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water,
150	and crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to
150	the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable.  Thus every
150	sort of confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness of
150	the human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light
150	and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes, having an effect upon
150	us like magic.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue
150	of the human understanding-there is the beauty of them--and the
150	apparent greater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the
150	mastery over us, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?
150	
150	Most true.
150	
150	And this, surely, must be the work of the calculating and rational
150	principle in the soul
150	
150	To be sure.
150	
150	And when this principle measures and certifies that some things are
150	equal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an
150	apparent contradiction?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	But were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same faculty
150	cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	Then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is
150	not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to
150	measure and calculation?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of
150	the soul?
150	
150	No doubt.
150	
150	This was the conclusion at which I was seeking to arrive when I said
150	that painting or drawing, and imitation in general, when doing their
150	own proper work, are far removed from truth, and the companions and
150	friends and associates of a principle within us which is equally
150	removed from reason, and that they have no true or healthy aim.
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	The imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior, and has
150	inferior offspring.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the
150	hearing also, relating in fact to what we term poetry?
150	
150	Probably the same would be true of poetry.
150	
150	Do not rely, I said, on a probability derived from the analogy of
150	painting; but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with
150	which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad.
150	
150	By all means.
150	
150	We may state the question thus:--Imitation imitates the actions of men,
150	whether voluntary or involuntary, on which, as they imagine, a good or
150	bad result has ensued, and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly.  Is
150	there anything more?
150	
150	No, there is nothing else.
150	
150	But in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with
150	himself--or rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion and
150	opposition in his opinions about the same things, so here also is there
150	not strife and inconsistency in his life?  Though I need hardly raise
150	the question again, for I remember that all this has been already
150	admitted; and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these
150	and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment?
150	
150	And we were right, he said.
150	
150	Yes, I said, thus far we were right; but there was an omission which
150	must now be supplied.
150	
150	What was the omission?
150	
150	Were we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose his
150	son or anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the loss with
150	more equanimity than another?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	But will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot
150	help sorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow?
150	
150	The latter, he said, is the truer statement.
150	
150	Tell me:  will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his
150	sorrow when he is seen by his equals, or when he is alone?
150	
150	It will make a great difference whether he is seen or not.
150	
150	When he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things
150	which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	There is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist, as
150	well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his
150	sorrow?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	But when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the
150	same object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct
150	principles in him?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	One of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law?
150	
150	How do you mean?
150	
150	The law would say that to be patient under suffering is best, and that
150	we should not give way to impatience, as there is no knowing whether
150	such things are good or evil; and nothing is gained by impatience;
150	also, because no human thing is of serious importance, and grief stands
150	in the way of that which at the moment is most required.
150	
150	What is most required? he asked.
150	
150	That we should take counsel about what has happened, and when the dice
150	have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best;
150	not, like children who have had a fall, keeping hold of the part struck
150	and wasting time in setting up a howl, but always accustoming the soul
150	forthwith to apply a remedy, raising up that which is sickly and
150	fallen, banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art.
150	
150	Yes, he said, that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune.
150	
150	Yes, I said; and the higher principle is ready to follow this
150	suggestion of reason?
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	And the other principle, which inclines us to recollection of our
150	troubles and to lamentation, and can never have enough of them, we may
150	call irrational, useless, and cowardly?
150	
150	Indeed, we may.
150	
150	And does not the latter--I mean the rebellious principle--furnish a
150	great variety of materials for imitation?  Whereas the wise and calm
150	temperament, being always nearly equable, is not easy to imitate or to
150	appreciate when imitated, especially at a public festival when a
150	promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre.  For the feeling
150	represented is one to which they are strangers.
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature
150	made, nor is his art intended, to please or to affect the principle in
150	the soul; but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper, which is
150	easily imitated?
150	
150	Clearly.
150	
150	And now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the
150	painter, for he is like him in two ways:  first, inasmuch as his
150	creations have an inferior degree of truth--in this, I say, he is like
150	him; and he is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part
150	of the soul; and therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him
150	into a well-ordered State, because he awakens and nourishes and
150	strengthens the feelings and impairs the reason.  As in a city when the
150	evil are permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the
150	way, so in the soul of man, as we maintain, the imitative poet implants
150	an evil constitution, for he indulges the irrational nature which has
150	no discernment of greater and less, but thinks the same thing at one
150	time great and at another small-he is a manufacturer of images and is
150	very far removed from the truth.
150	
150	Exactly.
150	
150	But we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our
150	accusation:--the power which poetry has of harming even the good (and
150	there are very few who are not harmed), is surely an awful thing?
150	
150	Yes, certainly, if the effect is what you say.
150	
150	Hear and judge:  The best of us, as I conceive, when we listen to a
150	passage of Homer, or one of the tragedians, in which he represents some
150	pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration, or
150	weeping, and smiting his breast--the best of us, you know, delight in
150	giving way to sympathy, and are in raptures at the excellence of the
150	poet who stirs our feelings most.
150	
150	Yes, of course I know.
150	
150	But when any sorrow of our own happens to us, then you may observe that
150	we pride ourselves on the opposite quality--we would fain be quiet and
150	patient; this is the manly part, and the other which delighted us in
150	the recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman.
150	
150	Very true, he said.
150	
150	Now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that
150	which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person?
150	
150	No, he said, that is certainly not reasonable.
150	
150	Nay, I said, quite reasonable from one point of view.
150	
150	What point of view?
150	
150	If you consider, I said, that when in misfortune we feel a natural
150	hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation, and
150	that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is
150	satisfied and delighted by the poets;-the better nature in each of us,
150	not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows the
150	sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is another's; and
150	the spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in
150	praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he
150	is, and making a fuss about his troubles; he thinks that the pleasure
150	is a gain, and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem
150	too?  Few persons ever reflect, as I should imagine, that from the evil
150	of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves.  And so
150	the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the
150	misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own.
150	
150	How very true!
150	
150	And does not the same hold also of the ridiculous?  There are jests
150	which you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic
150	stage, or indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused
150	by them, and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness;--the case
150	of pity is repeated;--there is a principle in human nature which is
150	disposed to raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by
150	reason, because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let
150	out again; and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre,
150	you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet
150	at home.
150	
150	Quite true, he said.
150	
150	And the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other
150	affections, of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be
150	inseparable from every action--in all of them poetry feeds and waters
150	the passions instead of drying them up; she lets them rule, although
150	they ought to be controlled, if mankind are ever to increase in
150	happiness and virtue.
150	
150	I cannot deny it.
150	
150	Therefore, Glaucon, I said, whenever you meet with any of the eulogists
150	of Homer declaring that he has been the educator of Hellas, and that he
150	is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things, and
150	that you should take him up again and again and get to know him and
150	regulate your whole life according to him, we may love and honour those
150	who say these things--they are excellent people, as far as their lights
150	extend; and we are ready to acknowledge that Homer is the greatest of
150	poets and first of tragedy writers; but we must remain firm in our
150	conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the
150	only poetry which ought to be admitted into our State.  For if you go
150	beyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter, either in epic or
150	lyric verse, not law and the reason of mankind, which by common consent
150	have ever been deemed best, but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in
150	our State.
150	
150	That is most true, he said.
150	
150	And now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry, let this our
150	defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in
150	sending away out of our State an art having the tendencies which we
150	have described; for reason constrained us.  But that she may impute to
150	us any harshness or want of politeness, let us tell her that there is
150	an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry; of which there are
150	many proofs, such as the saying of 'the yelping hound howling at her
150	lord,' or of one 'mighty in the vain talk of fools,' and 'the mob of
150	sages circumventing Zeus,' and the 'subtle thinkers who are beggars
150	after all'; and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity
150	between them.  Notwithstanding this, let us assure our sweet friend and
150	the sister arts of imitation that if she will only prove her title to
150	exist in a well-ordered State we shall be delighted to receive her--we
150	are very conscious of her charms; but we may not on that account betray
150	the truth.  I dare say, Glaucon, that you are as much charmed by her as
150	I am, especially when she appears in Homer?
150	
150	Yes, indeed, I am greatly charmed.
150	
150	Shall I propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, but
150	upon this condition only--that she make a defence of herself in lyrical
150	or some other metre?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	And we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of
150	poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her
150	behalf: let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to
150	States and to human life, and we will listen in a kindly spirit; for if
150	this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers--I mean, if there is
150	a use in poetry as well as a delight?
150	
150	Certainly, he said, we shall the gainers.
150	
150	If her defence fails, then, my dear friend, like other persons who are
150	enamoured of something, but put a restraint upon themselves when they
150	think their desires are opposed to their interests, so too must we
150	after the manner of lovers give her up, though not without a struggle.
150	We too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble
150	States has implanted in us, and therefore we would have her appear at
150	her best and truest; but so long as she is unable to make good her
150	defence, this argument of ours shall be a charm to us, which we will
150	repeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains; that we may not
150	fall away into the childish love of her which captivates the many.  At
150	all events we are well aware that poetry being such as we have
150	described is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the truth;
150	and he who listens to her, fearing for the safety of the city which is
150	within him, should be on his guard against her seductions and make our
150	words his law.
150	
150	Yes, he said, I quite agree with you.
150	
150	Yes, I said, my dear Glaucon, for great is the issue at stake, greater
150	than appears, whether a man is to be good or bad.  And what will any
150	one be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power,
150	aye, or under the excitement of poetry, he neglect justice and virtue?
150	
150	Yes, he said; I have been convinced by the argument, as I believe that
150	any one else would have been.
150	
150	And yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards
150	which await virtue.
150	
150	What, are there any greater still?  If there are, they must be of an
150	inconceivable greatness.
150	
150	Why, I said, what was ever great in a short time?  The whole period of
150	threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison
150	with eternity?
150	
150	Say rather 'nothing,' he replied.
150	
150	And should an immortal being seriously think of this little space
150	rather than of the whole?
150	
150	Of the whole, certainly.  But why do you ask?
150	
150	Are you not aware, I said, that the soul of man is immortal and
150	imperishable?
150	
150	He looked at me in astonishment, and said:  No, by heaven: And are you
150	really prepared to maintain this?
150	
150	Yes, I said, I ought to be, and you too--there is no difficulty in
150	proving it.
150	
150	I see a great difficulty; but I should like to hear you state this
150	argument of which you make so light.
150	
150	Listen then.
150	
150	I am attending.
150	
150	There is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil?
150	
150	Yes, he replied.
150	
150	Would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying
150	element is the evil, and the saving and improving element the good?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	And you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil; as
150	ophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body; as
150	mildew is of corn, and rot of timber, or rust of copper and iron: in
150	everything, or in almost everything, there is an inherent evil and
150	disease?
150	
150	Yes, he said.
150	
150	And anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil, and
150	at last wholly dissolves and dies?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	The vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each;
150	and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will; for
150	good certainly will not destroy them, nor again, that which is neither
150	good nor evil.
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	If, then, we find any nature which having this inherent corruption
150	cannot be dissolved or destroyed, we may be certain that of such a
150	nature there is no destruction?
150	
150	That may be assumed.
150	
150	Well, I said, and is there no evil which corrupts the soul?
150	
150	Yes, he said, there are all the evils which we were just now passing in
150	review:  unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice, ignorance.
150	
150	But does any of these dissolve or destroy her?--and here do not let us
150	fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man, when
150	he is detected, perishes through his own injustice, which is an evil of
150	the soul.  Take the analogy of the body: The evil of the body is a
150	disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body; and all the
150	things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through
150	their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so
150	destroying them.  Is not this true?
150	
150	Yes.
150	
150	Consider the soul in like manner.  Does the injustice or other evil
150	which exists in the soul waste and consume her?  Do they by attaching
150	to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so
150	separate her from the body?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	And yet, I said, it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish
150	from without through affection of external evil which could not be
150	destroyed from within by a corruption of its own?
150	
150	It is, he replied.
150	
150	Consider, I said, Glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether
150	staleness, decomposition, or any other bad quality, when confined to
150	the actual food, is not supposed to destroy the body; although, if the
150	badness of food communicates corruption to the body, then we should say
150	that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself, which is
150	disease, brought on by this; but that the body, being one thing, can be
150	destroyed by the badness of food, which is another, and which does not
150	engender any natural infection--this we shall absolutely deny?
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And, on the same principle, unless some bodily evil can produce an evil
150	of the soul, we must not suppose that the soul, which is one thing, can
150	be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another?
150	
150	Yes, he said, there is reason in that.
150	
150	Either then, let us refute this conclusion, or, while it remains
150	unrefuted, let us never say that fever, or any other disease, or the
150	knife put to the throat, or even the cutting up of the whole body into
150	the minutest pieces, can destroy the soul, until she herself is proved
150	to become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things
150	being done to the body; but that the soul, or anything else if not
150	destroyed by an internal evil, can be destroyed by an external one, is
150	not to be affirmed by any man.
150	
150	And surely, he replied, no one will ever prove that the souls of men
150	become more unjust in consequence of death.
150	
150	But if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul
150	boldly denies this, and says that the dying do really become more evil
150	and unrighteous, then, if the speaker is right, I suppose that
150	injustice, like disease, must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust, and
150	that those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of
150	destruction which evil has, and which kills them sooner or later, but
150	in quite another way from that in which, at present, the wicked receive
150	death at the hands of others as the penalty of their deeds?
150	
150	Nay, he said, in that case injustice, if fatal to the unjust, will not
150	be so very terrible to him, for he will be delivered from evil.  But I
150	rather suspect the opposite to be the truth, and that injustice which,
150	if it have the power, will murder others, keeps the murderer
150	alive--aye, and well awake too; so far removed is her dwelling-place
150	from being a house of death.
150	
150	True, I said; if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is
150	unable to kill or destroy her, hardly will that which is appointed to
150	be the destruction of some other body, destroy a soul or anything else
150	except that of which it was appointed to be the destruction.
150	
150	Yes, that can hardly be.
150	
150	But the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil, whether inherent or
150	external, must exist for ever, and if existing for ever, must be
150	immortal?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	That is the conclusion, I said; and, if a true conclusion, then the
150	souls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not
150	diminish in number.  Neither will they increase, for the increase of
150	the immortal natures must come from something mortal, and all things
150	would thus end in immortality.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	But this we cannot believe--reason will not allow us--any more than we
150	can believe the soul, in her truest nature, to be full of variety and
150	difference and dissimilarity.
150	
150	What do you mean? he said.
150	
150	The soul, I said, being, as is now proven, immortal, must be the
150	fairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements?
150	
150	Certainly not.
150	
150	Her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument, and there are
150	many other proofs; but to see her as she really is, not as we now
150	behold her, marred by communion with the body and other miseries, you
150	must contemplate her with the eye of reason, in her original purity;
150	and then her beauty will be revealed, and justice and injustice and all
150	the things which we have described will be manifested more clearly.
150	Thus far, we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at
150	present, but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a
150	condition which may be compared to that of the sea-god Glaucus, whose
150	original image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are
150	broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways,
150	and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and
150	stones, so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own
150	natural form.  And the soul which we behold is in a similar condition,
150	disfigured by ten thousand ills.  But not there, Glaucon, not there
150	must we look.
150	
150	Where then?
150	
150	At her love of wisdom.  Let us see whom she affects, and what society
150	and converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal
150	and eternal and divine; also how different she would become if wholly
150	following this superior principle, and borne by a divine impulse out of
150	the ocean in which she now is, and disengaged from the stones and
150	shells and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up
150	around her because she feeds upon earth, and is overgrown by the good
150	things of this life as they are termed:  then you would see her as she
150	is, and know whether she has one shape only or many, or what her nature
150	is.  Of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this present
150	life I think that we have now said enough.
150	
150	True, he replied.
150	
150	And thus, I said, we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument; we
150	have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice, which, as you
150	were saying, are to be found in Homer and Hesiod; but justice in her
150	own nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature.
150	Let a man do what is just, whether he have the ring of Gyges or not,
150	and even if in addition to the ring of Gyges he put on the helmet of
150	Hades.
150	
150	Very true.
150	
150	And now, Glaucon, there will be no harm in further enumerating how many
150	and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues
150	procure to the soul from gods and men, both in life and after death.
150	
150	Certainly not, he said.
150	
150	Will you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the argument?
150	
150	What did I borrow?
150	
150	The assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust
150	just:  for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case
150	could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men, still this
150	admission ought to be made for the sake of the argument, in order that
150	pure justice might be weighed against pure injustice.  Do you remember?
150	
150	I should be much to blame if I had forgotten.
150	
150	Then, as the cause is decided, I demand on behalf of justice that the
150	estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we
150	acknowledge to be her due should now be restored to her by us; since
150	she has been shown to confer reality, and not to deceive those who
150	truly possess her, let what has been taken from her be given back, that
150	so she may win that palm of appearance which is hers also, and which
150	she gives to her own.
150	
150	The demand, he said, is just.
150	
150	In the first place, I said--and this is the first thing which you will
150	have to give back--the nature both of the just and unjust is truly
150	known to the gods.
150	
150	Granted.
150	
150	And if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the
150	other the enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the beginning?
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all
150	things at their best, excepting only such evil as is the necessary
150	consequence of former sins?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Then this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is in
150	poverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things will
150	in the end work together for good to him in life and death: for the
150	gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be
150	like God, as far as man can attain the divine likeness, by the pursuit
150	of virtue?
150	
150	Yes, he said; if he is like God he will surely not be neglected by him.
150	
150	And of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed?
150	
150	Certainly.
150	
150	Such, then, are the palms of victory which the gods give the just?
150	
150	That is my conviction.
150	
150	And what do they receive of men?  Look at things as they really are,
150	and you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners, who
150	run well from the starting-place to the goal but not back again from
150	the goal:  they go off at a great pace, but in the end only look
150	foolish, slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders,
150	and without a crown; but the true runner comes to the finish and
150	receives the prize and is crowned.  And this is the way with the just;
150	he who endures to the end of every action and occasion of his entire
150	life has a good report and carries off the prize which men have to
150	bestow.
150	
150	True.
150	
150	And now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you
150	were attributing to the fortunate unjust.  I shall say of them, what
150	you were saying of the others, that as they grow older, they become
150	rulers in their own city if they care to be; they marry whom they like
150	and give in marriage to whom they will; all that you said of the others
150	I now say of these.  And, on the other hand, of the unjust I say that
150	the greater number, even though they escape in their youth, are found
150	out at last and look foolish at the end of their course, and when they
150	come to be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen;
150	they are beaten and then come those things unfit for ears polite, as
150	you truly term them; they will be racked and have their eyes burned
150	out, as you were saying.  And you may suppose that I have repeated the
150	remainder of your tale of horrors.  But will you let me assume, without
150	reciting them, that these things are true?
150	
150	Certainly, he said, what you say is true.
150	
150	These, then, are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed
150	upon the just by gods and men in this present life, in addition to the
150	other good things which justice of herself provides.
150	
150	Yes, he said; and they are fair and lasting.
150	
150	And yet, I said, all these are as nothing, either in number or
150	greatness in comparison with those other recompenses which await both
150	just and unjust after death.  And you ought to hear them, and then both
150	just and unjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt
150	which the argument owes to them.
150	
150	Speak, he said; there are few things which I would more gladly hear.
150	
150	SOCRATES
150	
150	Well, I said, I will tell you a tale; not one of the tales which
150	Odysseus tells to the hero Alcinous, yet this too is a tale of a hero,
150	Er the son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth.  He was slain in battle,
150	and ten days afterwards, when the bodies of the dead were taken up
150	already in a state of corruption, his body was found unaffected by
150	decay, and carried away home to be buried.  And on the twelfth day, as
150	he was lying on the funeral pile, he returned to life and told them
150	what he had seen in the other world.  He said that when his soul left
150	the body he went on a journey with a great company, and that they came
150	to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth;
150	they were near together, and over against them were two other openings
150	in the heaven above.  In the intermediate space there were judges
150	seated, who commanded the just, after they had given judgment on them
150	and had bound their sentences in front of them, to ascend by the
150	heavenly way on the right hand; and in like manner the unjust were
150	bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand; these also
150	bore the symbols of their deeds, but fastened on their backs.  He drew
150	near, and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry
150	the report of the other world to men, and they bade him hear and see
150	all that was to be heard and seen in that place.  Then he beheld and
150	saw on one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and
150	earth when sentence had been given on them; and at the two other
150	openings other souls, some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn
150	with travel, some descending out of heaven clean and bright.  And
150	arriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey,
150	and they went forth with gladness into the meadow, where they encamped
150	as at a festival; and those who knew one another embraced and
150	conversed, the souls which came from earth curiously enquiring about
150	the things above, and the souls which came from heaven about the things
150	beneath.  And they told one another of what had happened by the way,
150	those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things
150	which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth (now
150	the journey lasted a thousand years), while those from above were
150	describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty.  The
150	Story, Glaucon, would take too long to tell; but the sum was this:--He
150	said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered
150	tenfold; or once in a hundred years--such being reckoned to be the
150	length of man's life, and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a
150	thousand years.  If, for example, there were any who had been the cause
150	of many deaths, or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies, or been
150	guilty of any other evil behaviour, for each and all of their offences
150	they received punishment ten times over, and the rewards of beneficence
150	and justice and holiness were in the same proportion.  I need hardly
150	repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon as
150	they were born.  Of piety and impiety to gods and parents, and of
150	murderers, there were retributions other and greater far which he
150	described.  He mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits
150	asked another, 'Where is Ardiaeus the Great?' (Now this Ardiaeus lived
150	a thousand years before the time of Er: he had been the tyrant of some
150	city of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and his elder
150	brother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.)
150	The answer of the other spirit was: 'He comes not hither and will never
150	come.  And this,' said he, 'was one of the dreadful sights which we
150	ourselves witnessed.  We were at the mouth of the cavern, and, having
150	completed all our experiences, were about to reascend, when of a sudden
150	Ardiaeus appeared and several others, most of whom were tyrants; and
150	there were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been
150	great criminals:  they were just, as they fancied, about to return into
150	the upper world, but the mouth, instead of admitting them, gave a roar,
150	whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been
150	sufficiently punished tried to ascend; and then wild men of fiery
150	aspect, who were standing by and heard the sound, seized and carried
150	them off; and Ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand,
150	and threw them down and flayed them with scourges, and dragged them
150	along the road at the side, carding them on thorns like wool, and
150	declaring to the passers-by what were their crimes, and that they were
150	being taken away to be cast into hell.' And of all the many terrors
150	which they had endured, he said that there was none like the terror
150	which each of them felt at that moment, lest they should hear the
150	voice; and when there was silence, one by one they ascended with
150	exceeding joy.  These, said Er, were the penalties and retributions,
150	and there were blessings as great.
150	
150	Now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days,
150	on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey, and, on
150	the fourth day after, he said that they came to a place where they
150	could see from above a line of light, straight as a column, extending
150	right through the whole heaven and through the earth, in colour
150	resembling the rainbow, only brighter and purer; another day's journey
150	brought them to the place, and there, in the midst of the light, they
150	saw the ends of the chains of heaven let down from above:  for this
150	light is the belt of heaven, and holds together the circle of the
150	universe, like the under-girders of a trireme.  From these ends is
150	extended the spindle of Necessity, on which all the revolutions turn.
150	The shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel, and the whorl is
150	made partly of steel and also partly of other materials.  Now the whorl
150	is in form like the whorl used on earth; and the description of it
150	implied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped
150	out, and into this is fitted another lesser one, and another, and
150	another, and four others, making eight in all, like vessels which fit
150	into one another; the whorls show their edges on the upper side, and on
150	their lower side all together form one continuous whorl.  This is
150	pierced by the spindle, which is driven home through the centre of the
150	eighth.  The first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest, and the
150	seven inner whorls are narrower, in the following proportions--the
150	sixth is next to the first in size, the fourth next to the sixth; then
150	comes the eighth; the seventh is fifth, the fifth is sixth, the third
150	is seventh, last and eighth comes the second.  The largest (of fixed
150	stars) is spangled, and the seventh (or sun) is brightest; the eighth
150	(or moon) coloured by the reflected light of the seventh; the second
150	and fifth (Saturn and Mercury) are in colour like one another, and
150	yellower than the preceding; the third (Venus) has the whitest light;
150	the fourth (Mars) is reddish; the sixth (Jupiter) is in whiteness
150	second.  Now the whole spindle has the same motion; but, as the whole
150	revolves in one direction, the seven inner circles move slowly in the
150	other, and of these the swiftest is the eighth; next in swiftness are
150	the seventh, sixth, and fifth, which move together; third in swiftness
150	appeared to move according to the law of this reversed motion the
150	fourth; the third appeared fourth and the second fifth.  The spindle
150	turns on the knees of Necessity; and on the upper surface of each
150	circle is a siren, who goes round with them, hymning a single tone or
150	note.  The eight together form one harmony; and round about, at equal
150	intervals, there is another band, three in number, each sitting upon
150	her throne: these are the Fates, daughters of Necessity, who are
150	clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads, Lachesis and
150	Clotho and Atropos, who accompany with their voices the harmony of the
150	sirens--Lachesis singing of the past, Clotho of the present, Atropos of
150	the future; Clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her
150	right hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle,
150	and Atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones, and
150	Lachesis laying hold of either in turn, first with one hand and then
150	with the other.
150	
150	When Er and the spirits arrived, their duty was to go at once to
150	Lachesis; but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in
150	order; then he took from the knees of Lachesis lots and samples of
150	lives, and having mounted a high pulpit, spoke as follows: 'Hear the
150	word of Lachesis, the daughter of Necessity.  Mortal souls, behold a
150	new cycle of life and mortality.  Your genius will not be allotted to
150	you, but you choose your genius; and let him who draws the first lot
150	have the first choice, and the life which he chooses shall be his
150	destiny.  Virtue is free, and as a man honours or dishonours her he
150	will have more or less of her; the responsibility is with the
150	chooser--God is justified.' When the Interpreter had thus spoken he
150	scattered lots indifferently among them all, and each of them took up
150	the lot which fell near him, all but Er himself (he was not allowed),
150	and each as he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained.
150	Then the Interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of
150	lives; and there were many more lives than the souls present, and they
150	were of all sorts.  There were lives of every animal and of man in
150	every condition.  And there were tyrannies among them, some lasting out
150	the tyrant's life, others which broke off in the middle and came to an
150	end in poverty and exile and beggary; and there were lives of famous
150	men, some who were famous for their form and beauty as well as for
150	their strength and success in games, or, again, for their birth and the
150	qualities of their ancestors; and some who were the reverse of famous
150	for the opposite qualities.  And of women likewise; there was not,
150	however, any definite character them, because the soul, when choosing a
150	new life, must of necessity become different.  But there was every
150	other quality, and the all mingled with one another, and also with
150	elements of wealth and poverty, and disease and health; and there were
150	mean states also.  And here, my dear Glaucon, is the supreme peril of
150	our human state; and therefore the utmost care should be taken.  Let
150	each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow
150	one thing only, if peradventure he may be able to learn and may find
150	some one who will make him able to learn and discern between good and
150	evil, and so to choose always and everywhere the better life as he has
150	opportunity.  He should consider the bearing of all these things which
150	have been mentioned severally and collectively upon virtue; he should
150	know what the effect of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth
150	in a particular soul, and what are the good and evil consequences of
150	noble and humble birth, of private and public station, of strength and
150	weakness, of cleverness and dullness, and of all the soul, and the
150	operation of them when conjoined; he will then look at the nature of
150	the soul, and from the consideration of all these qualities he will be
150	able to determine which is the better and which is the worse; and so he
150	will choose, giving the name of evil to the life which will make his
150	soul more unjust, and good to the life which will make his soul more
150	just; all else he will disregard.  For we have seen and know that this
150	is the best choice both in life and after death.  A man must take with
150	him into the world below an adamantine faith in truth and right, that
150	there too he may be undazzled by the desire of wealth or the other
150	allurements of evil, lest, coming upon tyrannies and similar
150	villainies, he do irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet worse
150	himself; but let him know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes
150	on either side, as far as possible, not only in this life but in all
150	that which is to come.  For this is the way of happiness.
150	
150	And according to the report of the messenger from the other world this
150	was what the prophet said at the time:  'Even for the last comer, if he
150	chooses wisely and will live diligently, there is appointed a happy and
150	not undesirable existence.  Let not him who chooses first be careless,
150	and let not the last despair.'  And when he had spoken, he who had the
150	first choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny;
150	his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality, he had not
150	thought out the whole matter before he chose, and did not at first
150	sight perceive that he was fated, among other evils, to devour his own
150	children.  But when he had time to reflect, and saw what was in the
150	lot, he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice, forgetting
150	the proclamation of the prophet; for, instead of throwing the blame of
150	his misfortune on himself, he accused chance and the gods, and
150	everything rather than himself.  Now he was one of those who came from
150	heaven, and in a former life had dwelt in a well-ordered State, but his
150	virtue was a matter of habit only, and he had no philosophy.  And it
150	was true of others who were similarly overtaken, that the greater
150	number of them came from heaven and therefore they had never been
150	schooled by trial, whereas the pilgrims who came from earth, having
150	themselves suffered and seen others suffer, were not in a hurry to
150	choose.  And owing to this inexperience of theirs, and also because the
150	lot was a chance, many of the souls exchanged a good destiny for an
150	evil or an evil for a good.  For if a man had always on his arrival in
150	this world dedicated himself from the first to sound philosophy, and
150	had been moderately fortunate in the number of the lot, he might, as
150	the messenger reported, be happy here, and also his journey to another
150	life and return to this, instead of being rough and underground, would
150	be smooth and heavenly.  Most curious, he said, was the spectacle--sad
150	and laughable and strange; for the choice of the souls was in most
150	cases based on their experience of a previous life.  There he saw the
150	soul which had once been Orpheus choosing the life of a swan out of
150	enmity to the race of women, hating to be born of a woman because they
150	had been his murderers; he beheld also the soul of Thamyras choosing
150	the life of a nightingale; birds, on the other hand, like the swan and
150	other musicians, wanting to be men.  The soul which obtained the
150	twentieth lot chose the life of a lion, and this was the soul of Ajax
150	the son of Telamon, who would not be a man, remembering the injustice
150	which was done him the judgment about the arms.  The next was
150	Agamemnon, who took the life of an eagle, because, like Ajax, he hated
150	human nature by reason of his sufferings.  About the middle came the
150	lot of Atalanta; she, seeing the great fame of an athlete, was unable
150	to resist the temptation:  and after her there followed the soul of
150	Epeus the son of Panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning in
150	the arts; and far away among the last who chose, the soul of the jester
150	Thersites was putting on the form of a monkey.  There came also the
150	soul of Odysseus having yet to make a choice, and his lot happened to
150	be the last of them all.  Now the recollection of former tolls had
150	disenchanted him of ambition, and he went about for a considerable time
150	in search of the life of a private man who had no cares; he had some
150	difficulty in finding this, which was lying about and had been
150	neglected by everybody else; and when he saw it, he said that he would
150	have done the had his lot been first instead of last, and that he was
150	delighted to have it.  And not only did men pass into animals, but I
150	must also mention that there were animals tame and wild who changed
150	into one another and into corresponding human natures--the good into
150	the gentle and the evil into the savage, in all sorts of combinations.
150	
150	All the souls had now chosen their lives, and they went in the order of
150	their choice to Lachesis, who sent with them the genius whom they had
150	severally chosen, to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller
150	of the choice:  this genius led the souls first to Clotho, and drew
150	them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand, thus
150	ratifying the destiny of each; and then, when they were fastened to
150	this, carried them to Atropos, who spun the threads and made them
150	irreversible, whence without turning round they passed beneath the
150	throne of Necessity; and when they had all passed, they marched on in a
150	scorching heat to the plain of Forgetfulness, which was a barren waste
150	destitute of trees and verdure; and then towards evening they encamped
150	by the river of Unmindfulness, whose water no vessel can hold; of this
150	they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity, and those who were
150	not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary; and each one as he
150	drank forgot all things.  Now after they had gone to rest, about the
150	middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake, and then
150	in an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their
150	birth, like stars shooting.  He himself was hindered from drinking the
150	water.  But in what manner or by what means he returned to the body he
150	could not say; only, in the morning, awaking suddenly, he found himself
150	lying on the pyre.
150	
150	And thus, Glaucon, the tale has been saved and has not perished, and
150	will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken; and we shall pass
150	safely over the river of Forgetfulness and our soul will not be
150	defiled.  Wherefore my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the
150	heavenly way and follow after justice and virtue always, considering
150	that the soul is immortal and able to endure every sort of good and
150	every sort of evil.  Thus shall we live dear to one another and to the
150	gods, both while remaining here and when, like conquerors in the games
150	who go round to gather gifts, we receive our reward.  And it shall be
150	well with us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand
150	years which we have been describing.
